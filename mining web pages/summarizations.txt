Blocks in Ruby

The yield statement 
 As you know by now, a block must follow a method call. and without: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b8a869687801/] 
 Now redefine gimme to contain two yield s, and then call it with a block: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b91603795181/] 
 Another thing you ought know is that after yield executes, control goes back to the statement immediately following it. Kernel 's lambda method, for example, expects a block. An iterator method such as each without a block will return only an enumerator. Finally, stored procedures in Ruby — procs — use blocks as well.
-------------------
Mean Scored Summary
-------------------
An iterator munches data, usually in sequence, and with a little help, can actually do something useful with that data. The braces actually have higher precedence than do / end , and the syntax is more concise, as you can see: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b4d637945346/] 
 Multiple parameters 
 A block may use more than one parameter. Compare these calls, for example: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b5d055566786/] 
 With these: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b64343657285/] 
 Nothing doing with the last two, except returned enumerators. The yield statement 
 As you know by now, a block must follow a method call. We don't always see yield at work — it is part of the underlying, implicit control structure of iterator methods. Redefine gimme with an if statement: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b83857171859/] 
 Try gimme again with a very simple block (not an iterator!) and without: 
 [crayon-56082082d7b8a869687801/] 
 Now redefine gimme to contain two yield s, and then call it with a block:

"A networked economy will only reach its full potential if sectoral boundaries are dismantled and an even take-up of ICT in society is ensured."

Economic imperative and technology evolution will impel the IoT and its tremendous potential for increased monitoring forward, but citizen concern plays a minor role in operationalizing privacy. To wit: 
 1995: The global marketplace is doomed! "Unless security and privacy are protected, the [national information infrastructure] won't reach its full potential." (Seems to be healthy and evolving.) "A networked economy will only reach its full potential if sectoral boundaries are dismantled and an even take-up of ICT in society is ensured." (There are plenty of uneven socio-economic qualities to the Internet and related technologies.) The argument that privacy and security must be addressed for the IoT to blossom, then, can be met with head nodding and warm feelings because it assuages fears. Such a view flies in the face of the economically driven belief that self-regulation is the main force by which we should engender privacy, or that "[e]ducating and empowering citizens is the better way" to address privacy failures – two more orthodoxies.

Businesses (and IT) are under constantly increasing pressure to deliver faster, and with greater efficiency — but not at the expense of reliability of service or security. A common DevOps toolchain includes: 
 
 Version control and artifact repositories 
 Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery servers like Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity, and Go 
 Automated testing tools (including static analysis checkers and 
automated test frameworks) 
 Automated release/deployment tools 
 Infrastructure as Code: software-defined configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, CFEngine, and Puppet 
 Virtualization and containerization technologies such as Docker 
and Vagrant 
 
 Build management tools like Maven and Continuous Integration servers like Jenkins are already well established across the industry through Agile development programs. Something like this could violate securities laws. This means that a massive amount of activity is compressed into a small amount of time.

 Anderson: "One of the big gaps is that we've done great things for engineers and for analysts and for some of the operations people, but we really haven't dealt with the business people. I saw this when I was teaching at Cloudera; I'd have managers or even sometimes director-level people that publicly traded companies sitting through my entire four-day class.

You need some cluster infrastructure and, fortunately, it works very nicely with YARN. It basically treats your cluster as one giant machine of resources and gives you that illusion, ignoring things like network latencies and stuff. It's obviously not as mature an ecosystem as the Hadoop ecosystem but not everybody needs that maturity. Some people would rather have the flexibility of Mesos or of solving more focused problems. In Spark's case, it would be the so-called resilient distributed data sets. Behind the scenes, obviously you don't want that data to get lost if the machine goes down.

For this new report, San Francisco-based startup Relato mapped the intersection of companies throughout the data ecosystem — curating a network with tens of thousands of nodes and edges representing companies and partnerships in the big data space. Relato created the network by extracting data from company home pages on the Web and analyzed it using social network analysis; market experts interpreted the results to yield the insights presented in the report. The report ranks and compare the major players in the market — those who have enabled the development of the market — Hadoop platform vendors Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR. You'll see how we compare and contrast vendors using traditional metrics and various types of centrality. No longer do market analyses need to rely only on surveys and produce completely subjective quadrant charts.

Contrary to what many believe, insights are difficult to identify and effectively apply. In this post, I will discuss a few of the trends that have enabled insight as a service (IaaS) and discuss the general case of using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) EPM solution to corral data and deliver insight as a service as the next level of product. Insight as a service is a distinct layer of the cloud stack (I've discussed IaaS in earlier posts here and here ). EPM, in other words, is not just a matter of streamlining data provisions within the enterprise; it's an opportunity to provide a true insight generation solution. Throughout this evolution, improving the financial planning, forecasting, close, and reporting processes continue to be a priority for corporations. Like many other strategic enterprise applications, EPM started moving to the cloud a few years ago. The rise of big data — and the access and management of such data by SaaS applications, in particular — are enabling the business user to access internal and external data, including public data. This led to several different operational "data hubs" existing within each corporation. In most corporations, this data remains disconnected.

During a special edition of The O'Reilly Podcast , host and O'Reilly chief data scientist Ben Lorica interviewed Dr. Clare Bernard, a former particle physicist at CERN, who worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Bernard is now a field engineer at Tamr, where she's involved in a new project that aims to integrate and catalog a variety of data across an enterprise, while preserving metadata. Tracking metadata allows you to reproduce your data pipelines, and understand the lineage, and provenance of your data. I worked at CERN for a couple years and worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. BL: What kind of tools did you use in the academic world, for that type of work? Some of the other experiments proposed for the future are more related to precision measurements, rather than looking for new particles, which was what I was particularly interested in. What are your thoughts on the state of enterprise data in most large organizations? Another challenge is too many systems, and then even within one system you can have duplicate records about something like a customer. CB: One big initiative that a lot of companies have started on is centralizing all of their data into a central repository (the data lake). A lot of companies are realizing that this is an issue, and they're trying to track all of the metadata about the data they're putting into HDFS, into their data lake. They don't necessarily want the exact same transformations. BL: What are the tools for making that happen? CB: I think there are a lot of tools that address parts of this issue. BL: There's an open source academic project right now that's just starting, by Joe Hellerstein, one of the co-founders of Trifacta that attempts to do this; that's something you can share across different frameworks. My initial reaction was, "Wait, really?" CB: Customers often ask us: how do we integrate our data sets and make them into the type of data set that a data scientist would want to use? It's focused on connecting to as many systems as possible, and then capturing collaborative insights. The core Tamr difference is that Catalog can connect to any system.

Buy "The Hardware Startup: Building Your Product, Business, and Brand," by Renee DiResta, Brady Forrest, and Ryan Vinyard. Many first-time hardware founders are coming from software, or are hobbyist makers who haven't developed extensive personal networks within the hardware startup community. Fortunately, it's easier than ever to find fellow hardwarians. The Hackerspace Wiki is a great resource for finding like-minded people, and it has the added benefit of potentially helping you discover a shared workspace or machine shop. Building a well-rounded team right from the start is crucial. If you're planning to build a connected device, wearable, or any product that interfaces with your customer via software, you'll want to bring on a software engineer as early as possible, preferably one with some UI/UX design experience. If you went to a university with a strong alumni network, join your school's listserve or LinkedIn group. Founder incompatibility is one of the most common reasons young companies fail. Strong mentor relationships develop over time. Strategic help, such as participation in recruiting or introduction to customers, or expert value-adds, such as work on a particular project, typically increase the amount of equity offered.

Mean Scored Summary

Some of this reflects our as-yet immature understanding of compelling consumer IoT value propositions. Some of this stems from the fact that there are more aspects of design to consider. Tackling them independently creates an incoherent user experience (UX). We also need a common vocabulary for discussing them so that when we use the word "design," we're talking about the same things. This report introduces a framework for understanding the experience design of consumer IoT products. It explains the extra complexities that surround designing for connected products. How tricky those challenges prove will depend on: 
 
 The maturity of the technology you're working with 
 The context of use, and the expectations your users have of the system, and 
 The complexity of your service (for example, how many devices the user has to interact with) 
 
 But for most connected products, you'll need to consider the following factors: 
 Specialized devices, with different capabilities 
 Many of the 'things' in the internet of things are specialized embedded computing devices. And permissions in some smart home systems allow an "admin" user to grant or deny access to certain devices to others in the house, such as controlling TV/games console time for children or locking cupboards containing dangerous things. Few people enjoy feeling like sysadmins for their own homes. Parts of the system will inevitably go offline from time to time. Users control visual representations of objects and immediately see the outcome of their actions, which can be reversed. This breaks the link between user actions and visible, reversible consequences we have come to expect from modern software (PDF) . Designing for networks 
 Another major factor is the impact of the network on UX. Emails can be slow to download and Skype calls can fail. The video shows instant responses between the mobile app and washing machine, running over the Internet.
