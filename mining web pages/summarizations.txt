Jumping through the IT bottleneck 

 For business users, the current process for getting insight from big data is often long and sometimes frustrating. The tool is accessed through a GUI built with the business analyst in mind, as well as modules for IT operations and data science. Adopting such a culture relies on support from both the top and the bottom, whereby management encourages and enables experimentation, and individuals take initiative to learn about new tools and build products that solve problems of immediate interest to them.

Primarily, the data lake itself is often not safe for mass use due to complexity, security, and governance issues. Jumping through the IT bottleneck 

 For business users, the current process for getting insight from big data is often long and sometimes frustrating. Depending on the department and the project’s complexity, this process could take weeks, if not longer, to be completed. But big data does not have to remain the domain of power users—this is simply a limitation of the current tools. The tool is accessed through a GUI built with the business analyst in mind, as well as modules for IT operations and data science. Adopting such a culture relies on support from both the top and the bottom, whereby management encourages and enables experimentation, and individuals take initiative to learn about new tools and build products that solve problems of immediate interest to them. The open source ecosystem is where this kind of self-driven learning thrives, since you don’t need to go through the process of acquiring—and paying for—a commercial tool in order to start using it or teaching others how to use it. While more feasible for some tools than others (for example, most users probably wouldn’t run a Hadoop cluster on their personal machine), the principle remains the same: learning new skills and tools from open source can be very enabling, and is becoming increasingly crucial in today’s business environment. At the same time, business users should be proactive in searching out new tools and developing skills on their own. As tools like Kylo mature, everyone who wants to will be able to use data to make their jobs easier or more fun—hopefully both. Continue reading Enabling enterprise-wide data analytics.

Further clinical R&D into drug candidates and targets is turning up wasteful because published results can't be replicated (Freedman 2015, Begley 2012). There are similar problems with clinical research: Drug trials are published with mostly positive data supporting the claims, and negligible negative data (Ioannidis 2015). In this article, the discussion will mostly remain limited to preclinical research outcomes. The lack of replicability can be attributed to two broad reasons: a lack of consensus on protocols being used in research labs and the level of access to tools and equipment required for performing experiments. To solve these problems and standardize research equipment, we need the scientific community to reach a consensus on specific protocols and also provide generalized methods with sufficient flexibility for minor substitutions.

Close the time gap between analysis and action to bring about the next wave of improvements in efficiency and reliability—and magic. Embracing real time is the only option for companies seeking to elevate both the speed and the quality of information their business is analyzing. The world of renewable energy is a perfect example of the possibilities—and challenges—of the 21st-century economy. In a transportation firm, for example, data analytics may be able to recommend new truck routes given traffic conditions. The first step to speeding up the time-to-delivered-insight is real-time data access and insights dashboards. As we replace fossil fuels with renewables (solar, wind, and hydro), and seek to use less energy overall, it is clear that the interplay of numerous machines, human analysts, and timescales necessitate real-time data pipelines. While it takes a half hour or so to spin up a natural-gas turbine, solar panels and wind turbines depend on the weather; hydroelectric plants can be brought online in minutes, but need to pay attention to the long-term seasonal cycles of rain and snowfall, irrigation needs, and even fish migration. For example, one Internet of Things simulated application that tracks the status of nearly 200,000 wind turbines around the world shows how real-time data can empower businesses in the energy sector. Where does real time go next? The engineering work of getting data from sensors and users to databases and algorithms, and in turn getting analyses and decisions back to users (or actors like robots) is often the most important work in enabling data-driven action, especially in real-time contexts.

If you trained an AI with the entire body of Western music prior to Beethoven's birth in 1770, could it come up with something equally radical? All of these musicians were working out of traditions and styles that came before, whether the high classical music of Mozart and Haydn, or the blues of Leadbelly and Blind Lemon Jefferson. But whether an AI can push an artistic tradition to a new level is only the start of the problem. Talking about the decline of the music industry, Frank Zappa says : 
 One thing that did happen during the 60s was some music of an unusual or experimental nature did get recorded or did get released. We were better off with those guys than we are now with the supposedly hip young executives who are making the decisions of what people should see and hear in the marketplace. ", music would have taken a different course. That's not a technical requirement; it's a human one. Will Spotify and Pandora (or, more precisely, their algorithms) take risks on challenging music? If an AI wrote the 5th symphony, would a music exec say "pretty good, could be better, let's tweak the model and get something people will really like"? It will be at the mercy of record execs and program managers who aren't likely to say "Who knows what it is... if it sells, alright." And nobody will have the time or patience to go through it. There is certainly room for music-as-product; you need something to listen to in elevators. Yes, there is a market for Elvis on Velvet, and perhaps even paintings in doctors' offices. It will be about breaking with established norms and making something new.

Understanding the ELK stack

ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Logstash, which is in the front, is responsible for giving structure to your data (like parsing unstructured logs) and sending it to Elasticsearch. I think there are two main things that make ELK so popular and different. Those who just started their adventure with logs usually run into data structure problems, so-called mappings in Elasticsearch. There are multiple talks I would like to attend, especially related to container orchestration, Internet of Things, monitoring, and understanding data.

I recently sat down with Rafał Kuć, search consultant and software engineer at Sematext Group, to discuss the benefits and common pitfalls of using the ELK stack to manage logs. ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Logstash, which is in the front, is responsible for giving structure to your data (like parsing unstructured logs) and sending it to Elasticsearch. Why is it so useful for dealing with logs? Having hundreds of servers running different applications, virtual machines, containers—all that adds up to a lot of data that needs to be analyzed when problems happen or when you need to understand how things work. Being able to narrow down your data or easily find the information you are looking for really helps with operations-related tasks. Adding metrics to the equation gives you even more visibility compared to logs only. I think there are two main things that make ELK so popular and different. We see a variety of problems when we help clients at Sematext. Those who just started their adventure with logs usually run into data structure problems, so-called mappings in Elasticsearch.

Another part of the answer to your question is what I call the shared spiritual ancestry of both, or, as a colleague phrased it: “They are twins separated at birth.” Kubernetes directly builds on Google's decade-long experience with their own cluster scheduling system, Borg. The existence of the many Google-inspired tools and technologies out there are in a way both a cause and a consequence of that development. (Rumors that Google would use Men-in-Black-style neuralyzers during offboarding are strongly exaggerated.) At the same time, you still need to be able to drill down to explore causes. With event logging being another important pillar of monitoring (besides metrics, what Prometheus is for), I really look forward to the two talks about using Elasticsearch for monitoring.

I recently sat down with Björn Rabenstein, production engineer at SoundCloud and co-developer of Prometheus , to discuss Google-inspired tools and why Kubernetes and Prometheus work so well together. Another part of the answer to your question is what I call the shared spiritual ancestry of both, or, as a colleague phrased it: “They are twins separated at birth.” Kubernetes directly builds on Google's decade-long experience with their own cluster scheduling system, Borg. While Google engineers certainly still live far in the future, I daresay that the technological differences to “normal” mid-size tech companies are much less fundamental these days. The existence of the many Google-inspired tools and technologies out there are in a way both a cause and a consequence of that development. Another source of inspiration are the many whitepapers Googlers have published (like the aforementioned GFS and MapReduce papers) or just the brains of ex-Googlers that miss the awesome infrastructure after leaving the company. (Rumors that Google would use Men-in-Black-style neuralyzers during offboarding are strongly exaggerated.) Not only are single-host failures increasingly likely in large distributed systems, but those systems are explicitly designed to tolerate single-host failures. In the words of Rob Ewaschuk , symptom-based alerting is preferred over cause-based alerting. At the same time, you still need to be able to drill down to explore causes. With event logging being another important pillar of monitoring (besides metrics, what Prometheus is for), I really look forward to the two talks about using Elasticsearch for monitoring.

As soon as a data science application breaks down without explanation, people won’t trust it and, thus, will cease making data-driven decisions based on insights from the application. Finally, engineers and devops already love Go. Thus, in order to be productive in Go, data scientists must be able to gather data, organize data, parse values, and do arithmetic and statistics. Nevertheless, there are occasions where importing a well-understood and well-maintained package saves considerable effort without unnecessarily reducing clarity. There is also a Go API for Tensorflow in the works.
-------------------
Mean Scored Summary
-------------------
Without a great deal of forethought into testing and edge cases, you can end up in a situation where your data science application is behaving in a way you did not expect and cannot explain (e.g., because the behavior is caused by errors that were unexpected and unhandled). As soon as a data science application breaks down without explanation, people won’t trust it and, thus, will cease making data-driven decisions based on insights from the application. In contrast, heavy-weight Python data science applications may need readability-killing packages like Twisted to fit into modern event-driven systems and likely rely on an ecosystem of tooling that takes significant effort to deploy. Because Go is statically typed and because the Go community encourages and teaches handling errors gracefully , data scientists exploiting these features can have confidence in the applications and services they deploy. In the world of Python or R, errors may hide themselves behind convenience. Finally, engineers and devops already love Go. The point is not that Go is perfect for every scenario imaginable, so data scientists should use Go, or that Go is fast and scalable (which it is), so data scientists should use Go. Moreover, data scientists really should love Go, as it alleviates their main struggles while still providing them the tooling to be productive, as we will see below (with the added benefits of efficiency, scalability, and low memory usage). Sure, they get to train a machine learning model on occasion, but there are a huge number of business problems that can be solved via some data gathering/organization/cleaning and aggregation/statistics. Thus, in order to be productive in Go, data scientists must be able to gather data, organize data, parse values, and do arithmetic and statistics. Also, keep in mind that, as gophers, we want to produce clear code over being clever (a feature which also helps us as scientists or data scientists/engineers) and introduce a little copying rather than a little dependency. Nevertheless, there are occasions where importing a well-understood and well-maintained package saves considerable effort without unnecessarily reducing clarity. Data gathering, organization, and parsing 

 Thankfully, Go has already proven itself useful at data gathering and organization, as evidenced by the number and variety of databases and datastores written in Go, including InfluxDB , Cayley , LedisDB , Tile38 , Minio , Rend , and CockroachDB . The gonum organization provides numerical functionality that can power a great number of common data science related computations. In fact, you don’t have to abandon certain things you hold dear like Jupyter when working with Go. Check out these projects: 


 
 
 gophernotes —Go kernel for Jupyter notebooks 

 
 dashing-go —dashboarding 

 
 gonum/plot —plotting 
 


 In addition to this, it is worth noting that Go fits in so well with web development that powering visualizations or web apps (e.g., utilizing D3 ) via custom APIs, etc., can be extremely successful. Machine learning 

 Even though the above tooling makes data scientists productive about 90% of the time, data scientists still need to be able to do some machine learning (and let’s face it, machine learning is awesome!). There is also a Go API for Tensorflow in the works.
