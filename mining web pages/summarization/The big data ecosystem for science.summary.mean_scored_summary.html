    <body><p>A look at the data pipeline architecture for five key NERSC projects. Large-scale data management is essential for experimental science and has been for many years. Telescopes, particle accelerators and detectors, and gene sequencers, for example, generate hundreds of petabytes of data that must be processed to extract secrets and patterns in life and in the universe. 

 <strong>The data technologies used in these various science communities often predate those in the rapidly growing industry big data world, and, in many cases, continue to develop independently, occupying a parallel big data ecosystem for science (see Figure 1).</strong> <strong>This post highlights some of these technologies, focusing on those used by several projects supported by the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Centre (NERSC) .</strong> Continue reading The big data ecosystem for science.</p></body>
