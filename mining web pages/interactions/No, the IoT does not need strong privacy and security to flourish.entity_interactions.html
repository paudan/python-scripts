    <body><strong>Get</strong> notified when our free <strong>report</strong> "<strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Security</strong> in the <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong>," by Gilad Rosner, becomes available. "Without <strong>addressing privacy</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>, the <strong>Internet</strong> of Things will not reach its full potential." This <strong>refrain</strong> can be heard at <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>conferences</strong> , in <strong>opinion</strong> <strong>pieces</strong> in the <strong>press</strong> and in normative academic literature . If we don't  "get it right," then <strong>consumers</strong> won't embrace the <strong>IoT</strong> and all of the wonderful commercial and societal benefits it portends. This is false. It's a nice <strong>idea</strong>, imagining that <strong>concern</strong> for <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong> will curtail or slow technological growth. But don't believe it: the <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong> will develop whether or not <strong>privacy</strong> and security are addressed. Economic imperative and <strong>technology evolution</strong> will impel the <strong>IoT</strong> and its tremendous potential for increased monitoring forward, but <strong>citizen concern</strong> plays a <strong>minor role</strong> in operationalizing privacy. Certainly, popular <strong>discourse</strong> on the <strong>subject</strong> is important, but <strong>developers</strong>, <strong>designers</strong> , <strong>policy-makers</strong> and <strong>manufacturers</strong> are the key <strong>actors</strong> in embedding <strong>privacy</strong> <strong>architectures</strong> within new connected devices. Unsurprisingly, much current <strong>research</strong> shows that <strong>people</strong> are still uncomfortable and <strong>feel</strong> overexposed regarding their privacy. The prolific <strong>Pew Research Center</strong> tells us : 
 "...<strong>Americans</strong> <strong>feel privacy</strong> is important in their daily <strong>lives</strong> in a <strong>number</strong> of essential ways. Yet, they have a pervasive <strong>sense</strong> that they are under <strong>surveillance</strong> when in public and very few <strong>feel</strong> they have a great <strong>deal</strong> of <strong>control</strong> over the data that is collected about them and how it is used." <strong>Research</strong> across 26 European <strong>countries</strong> found: 
 "Rather high general <strong>perception</strong> of <strong>risks</strong> related to the <strong>disclosure</strong> of personal <strong><strong>information</strong> online</strong>" and "very strong <strong>expectations</strong> that personal <strong>information</strong> is used by the website <strong>owners</strong> / shared with third <strong>parties</strong> without the <strong>users</strong>' <strong>knowledge</strong> and consent." However, it's very hard to prove that <strong>people</strong> decline to buy <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>products</strong> now or in the <strong>future</strong> because of these concerns. Such proof would be difficult to obtain: it would require large <strong>surveys</strong> that not only laid out a common <strong>definition</strong> of the <strong>IoT (</strong> <strong><strong>something</strong></strong> that experts have yet to agree on <strong>)</strong> and then show a strong <strong>relationship</strong> between <strong>consumers</strong> declining to purchase <strong><strong>something</strong></strong> IoT-like and <strong>concerns</strong> over its <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong> risks. Or, specific <strong>vendors</strong> could disclose <strong>lackluster</strong> <strong>sales</strong> of their latest <strong>devices</strong>, <strong>ask</strong> <strong>consumers</strong> why they're not buying, and the <strong>response</strong> must then be poor <strong>privacy</strong> characteristics. <strong>(</strong>Such <strong>disclosures</strong> are not in <strong>vendors</strong>' interests.) The <strong>absence</strong> of this <strong>proof</strong>, however, does not stop <strong>professionals</strong> and the <strong>commentariat</strong> from proclaiming this <strong>constraint</strong> on the <strong>growth</strong> of connected devices. I call this 'The Orthodoxy of Chilled Innovation.' We've seen this <strong>before</strong> 
 The <strong>IoT</strong> is only the latest <strong>market domain</strong> in which we hear this orthodoxy. To wit: 
 1995: The global marketplace is doomed! "Unless … adequate <strong>protection</strong> for copyrighted <strong>works</strong> is ensured, the vast <strong>communications</strong> <strong>network</strong> will not reach its full potential as a true, global marketplace." <strong>(</strong><strong>Copyright</strong> <strong>violation</strong> was and is a rampant <strong>problem</strong>.) 2000: Electronic commerce is doomed! "The <strong>[</strong>Federal Trade] Commission believes that its proposed <strong>legislation</strong>, in <strong>conjunction</strong> with <strong>self-regulation</strong>, will ensure important <strong>protections</strong> for <strong>consumer privacy</strong> at a critical <strong>time</strong> in the <strong>development</strong> of the online marketplace. Without such <strong>protections</strong>, electronic <strong>commerce</strong> will not reach its full potential and <strong>consumers</strong> will not gain the <strong>confidence</strong> they need in <strong>order</strong> to participate fully in the electronic marketplace." (The proposed legislation never came to pass.) 2000: The national information infrastructure is doomed! "Unless <strong>security</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> are protected, the <strong>[</strong>national information infrastructure] won't reach its full potential." (Seems to be healthy and evolving.) 2004: The networked economy is doomed! "A networked <strong>economy</strong> will only reach its full potential if sectoral <strong>boundaries</strong> are dismantled and an even take-up of <strong>ICT</strong> in society is ensured." <strong>(</strong>There are <strong>plenty</strong> of <strong>uneven</strong> socio-economic <strong>qualities</strong> to the <strong>Internet</strong> and related technologies.) 2010: Online business is doomed! "If we don't get <strong>privacy</strong> right then the <strong><strong>online</strong> consumer</strong> will revolt, which will negatively impact <strong>everyone</strong> involved in <strong>online</strong> businesses." (Consumer revolution is a fantasy.) <strong>Time</strong> proved these vague <strong>assertions</strong> hollow: the <strong>Internet</strong>, the <strong>US</strong> national <strong>information infrastructure</strong> and e-commerce are doing just fine. The <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong> <strong>risks</strong> have not been addressed in any radical or comprehensive <strong>way</strong>, and people are still communicating, buying and surfing. The <strong>warm</strong> <strong>fuzzies</strong> 
 So, what <strong>accounts</strong> for this orthodoxy? My <strong>theory</strong> is that it's an attractive, intuitive <strong>argument</strong> influenced by the collective <strong>vulnerability</strong> people feel. Starting from the <strong>research</strong> that says <strong>people</strong> are worried about the <strong>intrusiveness</strong> of <strong>technology</strong>, one can imagine a <strong>desire</strong> to believe that our <strong>worries</strong> will translate into a will to slow <strong>things</strong> down, or a <strong>wariness</strong> on the <strong>part</strong> of <strong>IoT</strong> vendors. The <strong>argument</strong> that <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong> must be addressed for the <strong>IoT</strong> to blossom, then, can be met with <strong>head</strong> nodding and <strong>warm</strong> <strong>feelings</strong> because it assuages fears. It is, however, an empty sentiment. The <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong>, whatever it is, will happily march along with lousy <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>security</strong>, and we will be the poorer for it. Collective <strong>senses</strong> of the <strong>loss</strong> of <strong>privacy</strong> are a small <strong>part</strong> of what <strong>encourages</strong> the <strong>improvement</strong> of <strong>privacy</strong> preservation. Certainly, <strong>businesses</strong> large and small do <strong>think</strong> about what the <strong>populace</strong> might find " <strong>creepy</strong> ," but there is a wide <strong>gulf</strong> between considering <strong>opinions</strong> that might affect <strong>sales</strong> and actually baking <strong>privacy</strong> into devices. One should not confuse <strong>marketing</strong> with <strong>engineering</strong> or business practice. Regarding the <strong>IoT</strong>, the <strong>Orthodoxy</strong> of <strong>Chilled Innovation</strong> ignores recent <strong>history</strong> and economic <strong>logic</strong>: <strong><strong>businesses</strong></strong> seek <strong>frictionless</strong> <strong>transactions</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong> is rarely a <strong>differentiator</strong>, <strong>security</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> become more opaque <strong>topics</strong> over <strong>time</strong>, and <strong><strong>businesses</strong></strong> behave according to their (absence of<strong>)</strong> regulatory regimes. The <strong>danger</strong> of the <strong>Orthodoxy</strong> is that it may lull <strong>people</strong> into thinking that <strong>something</strong> will ensure their <strong>sense</strong> of <strong>privacy loss</strong> is addressed before the <strong>IoT</strong> remakes our <strong>world</strong> into a digital <strong>utopia</strong>; a false <strong>sense</strong> of security. <strong>Privacy</strong> does not protect itself, nor do <strong>markets</strong> arc toward the social <strong>goals</strong> of <strong>privacy</strong> and consumer protection on their own . <strong>Privacy</strong> is a technocratic <strong>pursuit</strong>: <strong>designers</strong>, <strong>engineers</strong>, <strong>product</strong> <strong><strong>managers</strong></strong>, risk and <strong>compliance</strong> <strong><strong>managers</strong></strong>, and <strong>company</strong> <strong>leaders</strong> are ultimately the <strong>ones</strong> who can actively improve the <strong>privacy posture</strong> of their devices. Complementing this are technology-neutral <strong>information</strong> <strong>policies</strong> that <strong>require privacy impact</strong> and <strong>security</strong> <strong>assessments</strong> and consumer protection. An unpopular <strong>view</strong> is that <strong>privacy</strong> is a paternalistic <strong>pursuit</strong> by the state. Such a <strong>vi<strong>e</strong>w</strong> fli<strong>e</strong>s in th<strong>e</strong> <strong>fac<strong>e</strong></strong> of th<strong>e</strong> <strong>e</strong>conomically driv<strong>e</strong>n <strong>b<strong>e</strong>li<strong>e</strong>f</strong> that <strong>s<strong>e</strong>lf-r<strong>e</strong>gulation</strong> is th<strong>e</strong> main <strong>forc<strong>e</strong></strong> by which w<strong>e</strong> should <strong>e</strong>ng<strong>e</strong>nd<strong>e</strong>r <strong><strong>privacy</strong></strong>, or that "[<strong>e</strong>]ducating and <strong>e</strong>mpow<strong>e</strong>ring citiz<strong>e</strong>ns is th<strong>e</strong> b<strong>e</strong>tt<strong>e</strong>r <strong>way</strong>" to addr<strong>e</strong>ss <strong><strong>privacy</strong></strong> failur<strong>e</strong>s – two mor<strong>e</strong> orthodoxi<strong>e</strong>s. <strong>Markets</strong> in liberal <strong>democracies</strong> cannot exist without <strong><strong>regulation</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>regulation</strong></strong> itself is not sufficient to <strong>effect</strong> the protections we seek. <strong>Privacy protection</strong> <strong>occurs</strong> through a <strong>plurality</strong> of necessary but <strong>insufficient</strong> steps . Wishing is not one of them. Public <strong>domain image</strong> on <strong>article</strong> and <strong>category</strong> <strong>pages</strong> via Pixabay .</body>
