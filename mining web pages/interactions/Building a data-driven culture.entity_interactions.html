    <body>O'Reilly Podcast: <strong>Qubole</strong> <strong>founder</strong> <strong>Ashish Thusoo</strong> on the <strong>importance</strong> of self-service data. What does it take to build a data-driven culture? In this O’Reilly <strong>Podcast</strong> <strong>episode</strong>, I pose that <strong>question</strong> to <strong>Ashish Thusoo</strong> , <strong>founder</strong> of Qubole . With his co-founder <strong>Joydeep Sen Sarma</strong> , <strong>Thusoo</strong> built a <strong>self-service data infrastructure</strong> at <strong>Facebook</strong> beginning in 2007. That <strong>infrastructure</strong> transformed <strong>Facebook’s</strong> <strong>culture</strong> and became <strong>part</strong> of practically every <strong>product decision</strong> that the company made. <strong>“A</strong> <strong>data</strong>-driven <strong>culture</strong> is a <strong>combination</strong> of <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>people</strong>, and <strong>technology</strong> that <strong>allows companies</strong> to bring <strong>data</strong> into day-to-day <strong>conversation</strong>,” Thusoo says. “Traditionally, when <strong>data</strong> was not available, a <strong>lot</strong> of the decision-making <strong>process</strong>, both at the tactical and strategic <strong>level</strong>, would be made through gut intuition. “Over a <strong>period</strong> of <strong>time</strong>, what has become clear is that, along with <strong>intuition</strong>, you need to augment that by <strong>testing</strong> those <strong>intuition</strong>s and those <strong>hypotheses</strong> with data. And that is what a data-driven culture enables. ... <strong>Data</strong> <strong>empowers people</strong> to actually talk about <strong>issues</strong> in a substantive <strong>way</strong>, rather than a subjective <strong>way</strong>.” 



 So, what <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>technology</strong> does a <strong>company need</strong> in order to become data-driven? <strong>Infrastructure</strong> <strong>that’s</strong> accessible to <strong>anyone</strong> in the <strong>organization</strong> is essential, says Thusoo. “You need to have the <strong>infrastructure</strong> be self-service to <strong>users.” Thusoo’s</strong> <strong>realization</strong> at <strong>Facebook</strong> back in 2007 was that the <strong>company couldn’t scale</strong> as long as <strong>decision-makers</strong> had to ask the <strong>data</strong> <strong>team</strong> for <strong>answers</strong> rather than fetching <strong>answers</strong> for themselves. <strong>“Facebook</strong> was an exponentially growing <strong>company</strong>...so, we had to make sure that we got out from sitting between the users.” 



 Even <strong>employees</strong> who aren’t able to develop their own sophisticated <strong><strong>queries</strong></strong> might be able to get started by <strong>taking</strong> pre-written <strong><strong>queries</strong></strong> and adjusting their parameters. <strong>“It’s</strong> easy to train <strong>people</strong> on <strong>interfaces</strong> that are in <strong>tune</strong> with their <strong>capabilities</strong>,” says Thusoo. “The <strong>motivation</strong> that you give them is...what used to take <strong>[</strong>your <strong>employees</strong>] <strong>weeks</strong> now might take just a few <strong>hours.”</strong>
