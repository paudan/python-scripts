    <body>During a special <strong>edition</strong> of The O'Reilly <strong>Podcast</strong> , <strong>host</strong> and O'Reilly <strong>chief</strong> <strong>data</strong> scientist <strong>Ben Lorica</strong> interviewed <strong>Dr. Clare Bernard</strong>, a former <strong>particle physicist</strong> at <strong>CERN</strong>, who worked on the <strong>ATLAS</strong> <strong>experiment</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider. <strong>Bernard</strong> is now a <strong>field engineer</strong> at <strong>Tamr</strong>, where she's involved in a new <strong>project</strong> that aims to integrate and catalog a <strong>variety</strong> of <strong>data</strong> across an <strong>enterprise</strong>, while preserving meta<strong>data</strong>. <strong>Key</strong> takeaways from their <strong>chat</strong>: 
 
 A <strong><strong>lot</strong></strong> of <strong>companies</strong> have big top-down <strong>master</strong> <strong>data</strong> <strong>management</strong> <strong>projects</strong>, and they put in <strong>place</strong> a <strong><strong>lot</strong></strong> of <strong>data</strong>-governance tools, which typically don't scale very well. It's really important to track where the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> came from, what the <strong>fields</strong> mean, and what <strong>transformations</strong> have been applied to that <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> over <strong>time</strong>, so that you can then use it for your analytics and you really understand what it means. Tracking <strong>metadata</strong> <strong>allows</strong> you to reproduce your <strong>data pipelines</strong>, and understand the <strong>lineage</strong>, and <strong>provenance</strong> of your data. <strong>Ben Lorica</strong>: <strong>Let</strong>'s <strong>start</strong> with a little <strong>bit</strong> about your background. You are a scientist by training, right? Clare Bernard: Yes. I was a particle physicist. I worked at <strong>CERN</strong> for a <strong>couple</strong> <strong>years</strong> and worked on the <strong>ATLAS</strong> <strong>experiment</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider. Then I got my Ph.D. and graduated in May. I've been working at Tamr since then, as a field engineer. <strong>BL</strong>: When you were a <strong>physicist</strong>, were you more on the computational <strong>side</strong> of physics? <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Yes</strong>, I was in a data-scientist-type role. I did help a little <strong>bit</strong> with <strong>collecting</strong> the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, but mostly, I spent my <strong>time</strong> analyzing the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> and coming up with <strong>measuring standard model</strong> <strong>physics processes</strong>, and searching for new <strong>types</strong> of particles that we might be able to discover. <strong>BL</strong>: What <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>tools</strong> did you use in the academic <strong>world</strong>, for that <strong>type</strong> of work? <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Particle</strong> <strong>physicists</strong> typically don't buy the <strong>type</strong> of <strong>software</strong> that is used in the private <strong>world</strong> — we write a lot of it ourselves. <strong>Particle</strong> <strong>physicists</strong> use a <strong>framework</strong> called <strong>Root —</strong> it's a statistical analysis package. <strong>BL</strong>: Is this <strong>like</strong> a distributed <strong>framework</strong>, <strong>like</strong> the <strong>type</strong> used in big data? <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Yes</strong>, you can create <strong>jobs</strong> that you send off to really large <strong>computing</strong> clusters. <strong>CERN</strong> has a huge <strong>system</strong> of distributed <strong>computing</strong>, so there's tier <strong>ones</strong> and tier <strong>twos</strong>, and you send <strong>data</strong> all around the <strong>world</strong> to do your analysis. BL: What made you decide not to go into an academic profession? <strong>CB</strong>: I really enjoyed my <strong>work</strong> in <strong>grad school</strong> and living at <strong>CERN</strong>, but I was very interested in <strong>figuring</strong> out what else I could do with my skills. Programming and <strong>data</strong> <strong>analysis</strong> <strong>translates</strong> well to the private <strong>world</strong> of big <strong>data</strong>. While I was at <strong>CERN</strong>, we discovered the <strong>Higgs-Boson</strong>, which was really exciting to be a part of. Some of the other <strong>experiments</strong> proposed for the <strong>future</strong> are more related to <strong>precision</strong> <strong>measurements</strong>, rather than looking for new particles, which was what I was particularly interested in. <strong>BL</strong>: <strong>Today</strong>, you've worked with several <strong>Fortune</strong> 500 <strong>companies</strong> as a <strong>Tamr</strong> field engineer. What are your <strong>thoughts</strong> on the <strong>state</strong> of <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>data</strong> in most large organizations? <strong>CB</strong>: Most large <strong>organizations</strong> are capturing huge <strong><strong>amount</strong>s</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, and there is a tremendous <strong>amount</strong> of <strong>value</strong> in that <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, but these <strong>enterprises</strong> are having a really difficult <strong>time</strong> getting at that <strong>value</strong>. They have very messy data that's in many different systems. Then, on the other <strong>side</strong> of the <strong>enterprise</strong>, they've got <strong>analysts</strong> and <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientists</strong> who want to derive <strong>value</strong> from the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, but who have trouble figuring out what <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> is there, and figuring out how to get that <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> and bring it together. Understanding how to deal with <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>quality</strong> <strong>issues</strong>, and getting <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> into a usable <strong>format</strong>, have been big <strong>hurdles</strong> for many companies. A major <strong>challenge</strong> is to embrace some of the <strong>messiness</strong> of <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>data</strong>, and some of the <strong>variety</strong> of that <strong>data</strong>, so that we can really unlock all of the potential. <strong>BL</strong>: What <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>systems</strong> are <strong>companies</strong> using for organizing and visualizing their data assets? <strong>CB</strong>: There are a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>patterns</strong> you see across enterprises. A <strong><strong>lot</strong></strong> of <strong>companies</strong> have big top-down <strong>master</strong> <strong>data</strong> <strong>management</strong> <strong>projects</strong>, and they put in <strong>place</strong> a <strong><strong>lot</strong></strong> of <strong>data</strong>-governance tools, which typically don't scale very well. Another <strong>challenge</strong> is too many <strong><strong>system</strong>s</strong>, and then even within one <strong>system</strong> you can have duplicate <strong>records</strong> about <strong>something</strong> like a customer. Figuring out where all of the <strong>data</strong> is located, when you have many different <strong>systems</strong>, is a very challenging problem. <strong>BL</strong>: How effective have data-governance <strong>tools</strong> been, in <strong>terms</strong> of managing different <strong>data sources</strong>, of variable quality? <strong>CB</strong>: One big initiative that a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>companies</strong> have started on is centralizing all of their <strong>data</strong> into a central <strong>repository</strong> (the <strong>data</strong> lake). Getting the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> into one <strong>place</strong> makes it a little <strong>bit</strong> easier to figure out what's there, but if it's not curated, it becomes even worse because now you've taken the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> away from the <strong>place</strong>s they were collected, and you've lost a <strong>lot</strong> of the <strong>information</strong> about how the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> was collected. <strong>BL</strong>: <strong>Actually</strong>, this is a topic that I've started to pay <strong>attention</strong> more to: metadata. CB: Yes, exactly. A <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>companies</strong> are realizing that this is an <strong>issue</strong>, and they're trying to track all of the <strong>meta<strong>data</strong></strong> about the <strong>data</strong> they're putting into <strong>HDFS</strong>, into their <strong>data</strong> lake. BL: How are they doing that? <strong>CB</strong>: A <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>companies</strong> are trying to build <strong>metadata</strong> catalogs. There are a few <strong>metadata</strong> <strong>catalogs</strong>, and they're specifically made for HDFS. Very few of these that are in the market have been successful, so far. One big <strong>issue</strong> for this, is that you don't really want just the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> that's in your <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lake and HDFS. You really want to be able to connect to all of the systems. You want it to be an easy adoption. <strong>BL</strong>: <strong>Let</strong>'s <strong>set</strong> the <strong>stage</strong> for why <strong>metadata</strong>, and good <strong>metadata</strong> management, is important. CB: Absolutely. <strong>Let</strong>'s <strong>say</strong> we have <strong>data</strong> about <strong>customers</strong> in a <strong>data</strong> lake, with <strong><strong>field</strong>s</strong> called "<strong>Given Name</strong>," "Last <strong>name</strong>," and then there's a <strong>field</strong> called, "Name." We don't really know where to start there. Which of all these <strong><strong>name</strong></strong> <strong>fields</strong> is actually the <strong><strong>name</strong></strong> of the customer? In <strong>reality</strong>, what's happened is, <strong>someone</strong> has created an <strong>ETL</strong> <strong>process</strong> that has taken this <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> from its original <strong>source system</strong>, has brought it into the <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> lake, and they've done some <strong><strong>transformations</strong></strong> on this <strong>name field</strong>, but now we've lost all of the <strong>information</strong> about what <strong><strong>transformations</strong></strong> were done and how that <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> has changed, and where the <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> was initially collected. Now, as the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientist, it's a little <strong>difficult</strong> to trust that <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, and to know how to use it and how to get value out of it. It's really important to track where the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> came from, what the <strong>fields</strong> mean, and what <strong>transformations</strong> have been applied to that <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> over <strong>time</strong>, so that you can then use it for your analytics and you really understand what it means. <strong>BL</strong>: This allows you to reproduce your <strong>data pipelines</strong>, understand <strong>lineage</strong>, and <strong>provenance</strong> of your data. CB: Yes. You really want to be able to <strong>leverage</strong> the other <strong>work</strong> that other <strong>people</strong> in the enterprise have been doing. You may not have just one <strong>data</strong> scientist, you may have <strong>hundreds</strong> of <strong>data</strong> scientists. If one <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientist is working on a <strong>project</strong> to clean up one <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> set and apply some useful <strong>transformations</strong> to it, then you really want all of your other <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> scientists to be able to take <strong>advantage</strong> of that work. <strong>BL</strong>: What you're saying is, not only am I exposing it to the other <strong>data scientists</strong> in my <strong>company</strong>, I'm also exposing it in a <strong>way</strong> that they can understand what I've done to the data. <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Exactly</strong>, because not all of your <strong>data scientists</strong> are doing the exact same project. They don't necessarily want the exact same transformations. They just want to be able to see what has been done by <strong>everyone</strong> else and <strong>leverage</strong> that <strong>work</strong> if it applies to their particular project. BL: What are the tools for making that happen? Generally, what would the <strong>tools</strong> look like that <strong>explain</strong> to my <strong>colleagues</strong> what I have done to the data? <strong>CB</strong>: I think there are a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>tools</strong> that <strong>address</strong> <strong>parts</strong> of this issue. This catalog, as I'm describing it, doesn't really exist. One of the <strong>reasons</strong> we've gotten interested in this <strong>problem</strong> is because this is <strong>something</strong> I see repeatedly when I go to <strong>customer</strong> <strong>sites</strong> — it takes them a really long <strong>time</strong> to find the data to get started. <strong>Catalogs</strong> that <strong>go</strong> across <strong>systems</strong> and that <strong>capture</strong> all of the <strong>metadata</strong>, including <strong>comments</strong> and collaborative <strong>features</strong> — I don't think that <strong>something</strong> like that <strong>exists</strong> in enterprise today. <strong>BL</strong>: There's an open <strong>source</strong> academic <strong>project</strong> right now that's just starting, by <strong>Joe Hellerstein</strong>, one of the <strong>co-founders</strong> of <strong>Trifacta</strong> that attempts to do this; that's <strong>something</strong> you can share across different frameworks. Obviously, you <strong>folks</strong> at <strong>Tamr</strong> are thinking about this <strong>issue</strong>, and other <strong>folks</strong> are thinking about it, so it must be because <strong>companies</strong> and enterprises are struggling with this or asking for this. CB: Yes, definitely. One of the <strong>things</strong> that <strong>happens</strong> a <strong>lot</strong> in <strong>meetings</strong> is that we'll show one of the initial <strong>screens</strong> of the <strong>Tamr Connect</strong> <strong>product</strong>, which just has a <strong>list</strong> of the <strong>sources</strong> that you've connected to the <strong>system</strong>, and sometimes we get a very emotional <strong>reaction</strong>, where <strong>people</strong> say something like: "Oh, this is what I want. I just want a list of the sources that I have." My initial reaction was, "Wait, really?" This is not supposed to be the screen that you get excited about. This is just a screen that says, "This is the data that we're working with." That's a <strong>problem</strong> that <strong><strong>people</strong></strong> are increasingly focused on, especially as more and more <strong><strong>people</strong></strong> have <strong>initiatives</strong> where they're trying to bring <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> into the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lake, and they're realizing that as they do that, they're losing a <strong>lot</strong> of context. <strong>BL</strong>: What is <strong>Tamr</strong>'s free <strong>Catalog</strong> <strong>software</strong>, and how does it solve <strong>problems</strong> for discovering, organizing, and visualizing data? <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Customers</strong> often ask us: how do we integrate our <strong><strong>data</strong> sets</strong> and make them into the <strong>type</strong> of <strong>data</strong> set that a <strong>data</strong> scientist would want to use? The <strong>Catalog</strong> <strong>product</strong> is a very lightweight, easy-to-use <strong>web application</strong> that is focused on the <strong>problem</strong> of discovering, organizing, and visualizing the <strong>data</strong> in the enterprise. The <strong>organization</strong> can share <strong>Catalog</strong> as a centralized <strong>repository</strong> of <strong>metadata</strong>, and then associate <strong>human knowledge</strong> with that data. It's focused on <strong>connecting</strong> to as many <strong>systems</strong> as possible, and then capturing collaborative insights. <strong>BL</strong>: Is <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>part</strong> of the catalog software? <strong>CB</strong>: The <strong>Catalog</strong> <strong>software</strong> is more focused on <strong>profiling</strong>, and right now doesn't have a whole <strong>lot</strong> of machine learning. Right now, <strong>Catalog</strong> is about connecting to a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>systems</strong>, giving you a <strong><strong>list</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>sources</strong></strong>, and then helping you get <strong>value</strong> out of that <strong><strong>list</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>sources</strong></strong>, so you can figure out which <strong>attributes</strong> can be associated with a particular entity. The <strong>vision</strong> going forward is that it will be more connected with <strong>Tamr</strong>'s <strong>Connect</strong> <strong>product</strong> — there will be good <strong>integration</strong> between the two, and there will certainly be <strong>machine</strong> learning components in both. <strong>BL</strong>: <strong>Have</strong> you gone to some of your <strong>customers</strong> and talked to them about Catalog? If so, what kind of response are they seeing? <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Yes</strong>, we actually already have 550 <strong>registrants</strong> and over 300 <strong>users</strong> from a wide <strong>variety</strong> of organizations. We've been working really closely with some of these <strong>Alpha</strong> <strong>customers</strong> to make sure that what we're building is solving their problems. We've had a <strong>lot</strong> of really good <strong>feedback</strong> about being able to increase <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>awareness</strong> and the <strong>level</strong> of <strong>organization</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> in the enterprise. <strong>BL</strong>: What do <strong>companies</strong> have in <strong>existence</strong> right now to solve the problems we've been discussing? <strong>CB</strong>: A <strong>lot</strong> of the <strong>tools</strong> that are being used to solve these <strong>problems</strong> are bigger, top-down, rule-based, data-governance <strong>approaches</strong>, that are maintained by a small <strong>number</strong> of <strong>administrators</strong> and start to break down at scale. The <strong>core</strong> <strong>Tamr</strong> <strong>difference</strong> is that <strong>Catalog</strong> can connect to any system. It's free, so we're really interested in driving adoption across the enterprise. <strong>Catalog</strong> is really only <strong>part</strong> of the solution. We start with <strong>Catalog</strong>, and then once you see where all the <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> is across your <strong>enterprise</strong>, and you see how this <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> relates to the <strong>projects</strong> that you want to do, then you can use the <strong>Tamr Connect</strong> <strong>product</strong> to connect those <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> sources and produce those <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> sets that are useful for your analytics. <strong>BL</strong>: <strong>Data</strong> <strong>sources</strong> could run the <strong>gamut</strong> of different <strong>types</strong> of systems, right? <strong>CB</strong>: <strong>Yes</strong>, you can download <strong>Tamr Catalog</strong> on your <strong>laptop</strong> to try it out, and connect to any <strong>XML</strong>, <strong>CSV</strong>, and <strong>Excel</strong> <strong>files</strong> that are on your <strong>laptop</strong>. You can connect to various databases, as well. The <strong>vision</strong> of the <strong>product</strong> is to connect to everything. We want to integrate with <strong>everything</strong> across the <strong>enterprise</strong> and really <strong>embrace</strong> that variety. You can download <strong>Tamr</strong>'s <strong>Catalog</strong> <strong>product</strong> for free here , and you can listen to the complete <strong>podcast episode</strong> in the player below.
