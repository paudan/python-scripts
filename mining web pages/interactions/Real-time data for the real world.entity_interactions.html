    <body>Close the <strong>time gap</strong> between <strong>analysis</strong> and <strong>action</strong> to bring about the next <strong>wave</strong> of <strong>improvements</strong> in <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>reliability—and</strong> magic. The <strong>number</strong> of <strong>devices</strong> that <strong>translate</strong> real-world <strong>events</strong> into a constant <strong>stream</strong> of <strong>zeros</strong> and ones continues to expand faster than ever. To <strong>account</strong> for this huge <strong>influx</strong> of new <strong>data</strong>, the <strong>technology</strong> used to capture, <strong>process</strong>, and analyze this information also needs to keep up. Embracing real <strong>time</strong> is the only <strong>option</strong> for <strong>companies</strong> seeking to elevate both the <strong>speed</strong> and the <strong>quality</strong> of <strong>information</strong> their business is analyzing. This <strong>article</strong> explores the <strong>importance</strong> of real <strong>time</strong> and the <strong>future</strong> of <strong>data</strong> <strong>analysis</strong> made possible by real-<strong>time</strong> <strong>technology</strong> in the <strong>form</strong> of both predictive <strong>analytics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, with a special <strong>focus</strong> on the <strong>world</strong> of <strong>alternative energy</strong> and the <strong>Industrial Internet</strong> of Things (IIoT). The <strong>world</strong> of renewable <strong>energy</strong> is a <strong>perfect example</strong> of the possibilities—and challenges—of the 21st-century economy. The <strong>promise</strong> of <strong>renewables</strong> is not just staunching the <strong>flow</strong> of environmental <strong><strong>costs</strong></strong> of the developed <strong>world’s</strong> <strong>lifestyle</strong>, but spreading economic <strong>growth</strong> globally without incurring these <strong><strong>costs</strong></strong> in the first place. The <strong>goal</strong> of transforming an <strong>industry</strong> to be more efficient and responsive is thrown into high <strong>relief</strong> in the <strong>case</strong> of energy. However, across all <strong>industries</strong>, the <strong>ability</strong> to intake, understand, and <strong>respond</strong> to <strong>data offers</strong> the <strong>possibility</strong> of radical <strong>change</strong> for the better, specifically in those very realms of <strong>efficiency</strong> and responsiveness. Up to now, the main <strong>benefits</strong> that <strong>data</strong> has brought to <strong>industries</strong> have been driven by analytical <strong>efforts</strong> separate from operational <strong>data</strong> pipelines. <strong>Business</strong> <strong>analysts</strong> examine <strong>data</strong>, find <strong>trends</strong>, propose <strong>tests</strong>, and deliver <strong>recommendations</strong>, which are then implemented by the operations side. But to continue <strong>gaining</strong> <strong>returns</strong> from <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong>analysis</strong></strong>, the <strong>timescales</strong> at which <strong><strong>analysis</strong></strong> operates have become <strong>finer</strong> and <strong>finer</strong>. In a <strong>transportation firm</strong>, for <strong>example</strong>, <strong>data analytics</strong> may be able to recommend new <strong>truck</strong> <strong>routes</strong> given traffic conditions. In <strong>order</strong> to implement those <strong>recommendations</strong>, however, the traffic <strong>conditions</strong> need to be recognized—and that <strong>analysis</strong> propagated to drivers—in real time. As “drivers” <strong>comes</strong> to mean “other <strong>computers</strong>,” this need remains central. The <strong>machine learning</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> that <strong>data</strong> scientists have developed over the past <strong>decades</strong> have <strong>immense power</strong> to categorize, <strong>predict</strong>, and detect anomalies. The first <strong>step</strong> to <strong>speeding</strong> up the time-to-delivered-insight is real-time <strong>data</strong> <strong>access</strong> and insights dashboards. The next <strong>step</strong> is to adapt <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>techniques</strong> to real-time <strong><strong>data</strong>—this</strong> means not only supplying incoming <strong>data</strong> for <strong>analysis</strong>, but also developing responsive <strong>algorithms</strong> that <strong>update</strong> on the <strong>basis</strong> of new <strong>data</strong>. Real-time <strong><strong>analytics</strong></strong> in the renewable <strong><strong>energy industry</strong></strong> 

 As mentioned, the renewable <strong><strong>energy industry</strong></strong> offers a great <strong>example</strong> of using real-time <strong><strong>analytics</strong></strong> to deliver <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>responsiveness</strong> to <strong>everyday industry</strong> operations. As we replace <strong>fossil</strong> <strong>fuels</strong> with <strong>renewables</strong> (solar, wind, and <strong>hydro</strong>), and seek to use less <strong>energy overall</strong>, it is clear that the <strong>interplay</strong> of numerous <strong>machines</strong>, human <strong>analysts</strong>, and <strong>timescales</strong> necessitate real-time data pipelines. For much of the 20th <strong>century</strong>, the <strong>grid’s</strong> electrical <strong>needs</strong> could be satisfied by fossil-fuel-burning <strong>power</strong> plants. While daily and seasonal <strong>fluctuations</strong> could be predicted at a <strong>coarse level</strong>, <strong>plants</strong> would have to overproduce to ensure sufficient <strong>power</strong> to handle unexpected <strong>spikes</strong> in demand. <strong>Brownouts</strong> and <strong>surges</strong> were distressingly common, and of <strong>course</strong>, more fuel was burned than was needed. As renewables joined the grid, supply became much more complicated. While it takes a <strong>half hour</strong> or so to spin up a natural-gas <strong>turbine</strong>, solar <strong>panels</strong> and wind <strong>turbine</strong>s depend on the <strong>weather</strong>; hydroelectric <strong>plants</strong> can be brought <strong>online</strong> in <strong>minutes</strong>, but need to pay <strong>attention</strong> to the long-term seasonal <strong>cycles</strong> of <strong>rain</strong> and <strong>snowfall</strong>, <strong>irrigation</strong> needs, and even fish migration. Meanwhile, the daily <strong>cycles</strong> of human <strong><strong>energy</strong></strong> needs are divorced from <strong>(</strong>and sometimes in <strong>conflict</strong> with) natural <strong><strong>energy</strong></strong> <strong>supplies</strong>: <strong><strong>home</strong> air</strong> <strong>conditioners</strong> switching on in <strong>summer</strong> <strong>evenings</strong> as <strong>families</strong> return <strong>home</strong>, just as the <strong>sun</strong> sets and the <strong>wind</strong> dies down. Real-time <strong>analysis—and action on—data</strong> at the <strong>level</strong> of the individual <strong>energy source</strong> and the individual <strong>energy consumer</strong> is necessary to <strong>balance</strong> all these factors. Tracking supply and <strong>demand</strong> at this granular <strong>level</strong> <strong>enables</strong> the <strong>grid</strong> to <strong>balance supply</strong> and load by the <strong>second—a</strong> <strong>responsiveness</strong> that shows up in the <strong>consumer experience</strong> as <strong>reliability</strong>, with reduced or eliminated <strong>power</strong> outages and spikes. On the <strong>production side</strong>, <strong>data</strong> <strong>analysis</strong> provides reliability, too. For <strong>example</strong>, one <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong> simulated <strong>application</strong> that <strong>tracks</strong> the <strong>status</strong> of nearly 200,000 <strong>wind</strong> <strong>turbines</strong> around the <strong>world</strong> shows how real-time <strong>data</strong> can empower <strong>businesses</strong> in the energy sector. This <strong>simulation</strong> provides not only real-time <strong>status</strong> <strong>dashboards</strong>, but also—crucially—predictive <strong>analytics</strong> that gives <strong>turbine</strong> <strong>operators</strong> insight into when machines are in danger of failing. This enables not only preventive <strong>maintenance</strong>, but predictive <strong>maintenance</strong>—servicing <strong>machines</strong> before they fail, and dispatching both <strong>personnel</strong> and material to where they’ll be needed. Where does real time go next? From <strong>ML</strong> to AI 

 It’s almost hidden in that last <strong>paragraph</strong>, but bringing <strong>analytics</strong> into real <strong>time</strong> <strong>gets</strong> you a <strong>reach</strong> into the future, a <strong>bit</strong> of everyday magic. <strong>O’Reilly’s</strong> Mike <strong>Loukides</strong> and <strong>Ben Lorica</strong> recently discussed “ What is Artificial Intelligence? <strong>”</strong> and pointed out that <strong>technologies</strong> creep from being “robots<strong>”</strong> or “AI<strong>”</strong> into our <strong>everyday</strong> lives as they’re implemented and become familiar. The <strong>bottom line</strong> to this <strong>transfer</strong> of <strong>technology</strong> from fantasy to <strong>reality</strong> is that it works seamlessly and in the same <strong>time frame</strong> as the real world. Real-time <strong>data analytics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> provide the <strong>keys</strong> to deploying more and more <strong>services</strong> that offer “magical” abilities. By <strong>synthesizing</strong> not only vast <strong><strong>amounts</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>information</strong></strong>, but vast <strong><strong>amounts</strong></strong> of current <strong><strong>information</strong></strong>, real-time <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> contextualizes current <strong>observations</strong> with historical <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, and <strong>delivers</strong> either <strong>action</strong> or <strong>augmentation</strong> to human decision-makers. In <strong>today</strong>'s data-driven <strong>world</strong>, it's easy to get caught up in the latest <strong>machine</strong> learning <strong>techniques</strong> or get <strong>deeper</strong> and <strong>deeper</strong> into feature engineering . In <strong>moments</strong> of <strong>sober realism</strong>, we spend <strong>time</strong> (commiserating over) data wrangling. But even this <strong>focus</strong> on the “dirty <strong>work”</strong> of <strong>data</strong> <strong>science</strong> <strong>misses</strong> the underlying <strong>data</strong> pipelines. The <strong>engineering <strong>work</strong></strong> of getting <strong>data</strong> from <strong>sensors</strong> and <strong><strong>users</strong></strong> to <strong>data</strong>bases and <strong>algorithms</strong>, and in <strong>turn</strong> getting <strong>analyses</strong> and <strong>decisions</strong> back to <strong><strong>users</strong></strong> (or <strong>actors</strong> like <strong>robots</strong>) is often the most important <strong>work</strong> in <strong>enabling</strong> <strong>data</strong>-driven <strong>action</strong>, especially in real-time contexts.
