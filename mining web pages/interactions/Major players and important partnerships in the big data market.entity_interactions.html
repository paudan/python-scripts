    <body><strong>Download</strong> our new free <strong>report</strong> "<strong>Mapping Big Data</strong>: A <strong>Data Driven Market Report</strong>" for <strong>insights</strong> into the <strong>shape</strong> and <strong>structure</strong> of the big <strong>data</strong> market. Who are the major <strong>players</strong> in the big <strong>data</strong> market? What are the sectors that make up the market and how do they relate? Which among the thousands of partnerships are most important? These are just a <strong>handful</strong> of <strong>questions</strong> we explore in-depth in the new O'Reilly <strong>report</strong> now available for free <strong>download</strong>: Mapping <strong>Big Data</strong>: A Data Driven Market Report . For this new <strong>report</strong>, <strong>San</strong> Francisco-based <strong>startup</strong> <strong>Relato</strong> mapped the <strong>intersection</strong> of <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> throughout the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> ecosystem — curating a <strong>network</strong> with <strong>tens</strong> of <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong>nodes</strong> and <strong>edges</strong> representing <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> and <strong>partnerships</strong> in the big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> space. <strong>Relato</strong> created the <strong>network</strong> by <strong>extracting</strong> <strong>data</strong> from <strong>company home</strong> <strong>pages</strong> on the <strong>Web</strong> and analyzed it using social <strong>network</strong> analysis; <strong>market</strong> <strong>experts</strong> interpreted the <strong>results</strong> to yield the <strong>insights</strong> presented in the report. The <strong>result</strong> is a <strong>preview</strong> of the <strong>future</strong> of <strong>market</strong> reports. The <strong>report</strong> begins with an <strong>introduction</strong> to the <strong>data</strong> set and a <strong>history</strong> of the market. We present a <strong>market segmentation</strong> by <strong>cluster analysis</strong>, which shows the <strong>sub-markets</strong> within the <strong>data</strong> ecosystem, with similar <strong>vendors</strong> in like clusters. We go on to analyze how these <strong>markets</strong> connect with one another and <strong>explore</strong> some of the surprising insights. The <strong>report</strong> ranks and <strong>compare</strong> the major <strong>players</strong> in the <strong><strong>market</strong></strong> — those who have enabled the <strong>development</strong> of the <strong><strong>market</strong></strong> — <strong>Hadoop</strong> <strong>platform</strong> <strong>vendors</strong> <strong>Cloudera</strong>, <strong>Hortonworks</strong>, and MapR. You'll see how we compare and <strong>contrast</strong> <strong>vendors</strong> using traditional <strong>metrics</strong> and various <strong>types</strong> of centrality. The <strong>report</strong> characterizes the <strong>vendors</strong>' <strong>partnership</strong> <strong>networks</strong> and will give you a better <strong>understanding</strong> of the <strong>vendors</strong> themselves. No longer do <strong>market</strong> <strong>analyses</strong> need to rely only on <strong>surveys</strong> and produce completely subjective <strong>quadrant</strong> charts. This <strong>report</strong> <strong>reveals</strong> that <strong><strong>market</strong></strong> <strong>report</strong>s can be based on <strong>data</strong> collected directly from the <strong>footprint</strong> of the <strong><strong>market</strong></strong> <strong>players</strong> themselves, in their <strong>course</strong> of doing business.
