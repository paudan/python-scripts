    <body><strong>Buy</strong> "<strong>The Hardware Startup</strong>: <strong>Building Your Product</strong>, <strong>Business</strong>, and <strong>Brand</strong>," by <strong>Renee DiResta</strong>, <strong>Brady Forrest</strong>, and Ryan Vinyard. Note: this <strong>post</strong> is an <strong>excerpt</strong> from the book. <strong>Hardware</strong> <strong>founders</strong> should strive for hypothesis-driven <strong>development</strong> and <strong>validate</strong> their <strong>ideas</strong> with customers as early as possible. This can be done before or alongside the prototyping process, but it should absolutely be done before moving toward tooling. Changing your <strong>design</strong> or switching <strong>technologies</strong> becomes much more expensive <strong>once</strong> you've moved beyond a <strong>prototype</strong>, so it's important to get it right the first time. The <strong>foundation</strong> of effective validated <strong>learning</strong> is conversation . You want to talk to — and, more importantly, listen to — several distinct <strong>groups</strong> of <strong>people</strong> who will be critical to your <strong>success</strong> as a company. Your <strong>fellow</strong> <strong>hardwarians</strong> 
 The first <strong>group</strong> of <strong>helpers</strong> on the <strong>road</strong> to <strong>building</strong> your <strong>product</strong> are <strong>fellow</strong> <strong>hardware</strong> founders. Not everyone within the <strong>hardware community</strong> is a potential <strong>customer</strong> who will help you unearth the <strong>roots</strong> of a particular pain point. But within this community are the people who have done it before. They have extensive <strong>experience</strong> and can provide invaluable <strong>guidance</strong> for specific problems. They'll help you reduce waste in the production process. <strong>Certain</strong> steps in the <strong>development process</strong>, such as <strong>finding</strong> a <strong>contract manufacturer</strong>, are often driven by word-of-mouth referrals. Networking with other <strong>founders</strong> building <strong>products</strong> in your <strong>space</strong> will give you a better <strong>chance</strong> of getting these <strong>things</strong> right the first time. Many first-time <strong>hardware</strong> <strong>founders</strong> are coming from <strong>software</strong>, or are hobbyist <strong>makers</strong> who haven't developed extensive personal <strong>networks</strong> within the <strong>hardware</strong> startup community. Fortunately, it's easier than ever to find fellow hardwarians. Although <strong>online</strong> <strong>communi<strong>ties</strong></strong> can have strong <strong>ties</strong>, they aren't a <strong>substitute</strong> for a local network. Even if you live in a smaller <strong>town</strong>, <strong>meeting fellow hardware</strong> <strong>hackers</strong> nearby can help you discover <strong>facilities</strong>, <strong>suppliers</strong>, and other resources. These connections are particularly valuable early on because you'll likely be prototyping locally. The <strong>Hackerspace Wiki</strong> is a great <strong>resource</strong> for <strong>finding</strong> like-minded <strong>people</strong>, and it has the added <strong>benefit</strong> of potentially helping you discover a shared <strong>workspace</strong> or machine shop. <strong>See</strong> if there's a <strong>TechShop</strong> or <strong>FabLab</strong> in your area. In <strong>addition</strong> to <strong>teaching</strong> <strong>classes</strong>, these <strong>spots</strong> often host <strong>community</strong> <strong>events</strong> such as <strong>show-and-tells</strong> and happy hours. The <strong>Hardware Startup Wiki</strong> and The <strong>Maker Map</strong> can also help you discover what's happening locally; these two <strong>sites</strong> are maintained in <strong>part</strong> by the <strong>authors</strong> of this <strong>book</strong>, but they rely heavily on community contribution. Your <strong>co-founder</strong> and <strong>team</strong> 
 If you already have a <strong>co-founder</strong>, or an early founding <strong>team</strong>, that's awesome! If not, you're going to need to find one. It can take several <strong>months</strong> to <strong>convince someone</strong> to join your <strong>team</strong>, particularly if you haven't received funding. A co-founder <strong>relationship</strong> is like a <strong>marriage</strong>: you're going to be building a <strong>company</strong> with this <strong>person</strong> for <strong>years</strong>, so it's important to find an equally committed <strong>partner</strong> and establish good <strong>channels</strong> of <strong>communication</strong> right from the start. If you're looking for a co-founder, <strong>consider</strong> signing up for a co-founder <strong>matching community</strong> such as <strong>FounderDating</strong> , CoFoundersLab , or Collab-Finder . Building a well-rounded team right from the start is crucial. In the early <strong>days</strong>, this involves <strong>finding</strong> <strong>people</strong> you work well with, who have complementary skill sets. Know what you yourself bring to the table as well as what you need. At a minimum, you need one <strong>founder</strong> with <strong>hardware experience</strong> and another with <strong>business experience</strong> (or a second technical <strong>founder</strong> who's willing to learn). If you're technical, you probably have a good sense of what it takes to build a product. However, you might not understand <strong>sales</strong>, branding, or marketing very well, and at some <strong>point</strong>, <strong>someone</strong> needs to <strong>convince</strong> <strong>people</strong> to buy your device. Having a well-rounded <strong>business development person</strong> as an early <strong>team member</strong> can help ensure that you don't neglect this critical part of company-building. If you're a nontechnical founder, you absolutely must recruit a technical partner. It will be virtually impossible to raise <strong>funding</strong> or efficiently get to <strong>market</strong> without one (in <strong>terms</strong> of both time and cost). A technical <strong>co-founder</strong> shouldn't be a hired <strong>gun</strong> who you bring on to build your idea. You need to attract a <strong>teammate</strong> who <strong>shares</strong> your <strong>vision</strong> and wants to partner with you. <strong>Sales</strong> and finance <strong>experience</strong> isn't particularly useful in the early <strong>days</strong> of the <strong>company</strong>, so it's important to spec out specifically what you will be doing while your <strong>co-founder</strong> builds. If you're planning to build a connected <strong>device</strong>, wearable, or any <strong>product</strong> that interfaces with your <strong>customer</strong> via <strong>software</strong>, you'll want to bring on a <strong>software</strong> engineer as early as possible, preferably one with some UI/UX design experience. <strong>Software</strong> is the <strong>arena</strong> where a <strong>hardware company</strong> can continue to innovate even after the physical product has been shipped, which is incredibly important. Some <strong>founders</strong> choose to outsource <strong>software development</strong> in the <strong>beginning</strong>, but you'll need to line up <strong>someone</strong> to own that critical product role fairly early on. It's beneficial to build a <strong>pipeline</strong> of potential <strong>talent</strong> right from the start. <strong>Talent</strong> <strong>acquisition</strong> is yet another <strong>reason</strong> to get plugged into your local hardware community. Increasingly common in most <strong>cities</strong>, <strong>hackathons</strong> are a great <strong>low-pressure way</strong> to work on a <strong>project</strong> and meet people. If you went to a <strong>university</strong> with a strong <strong>alumni network</strong>, <strong>join</strong> your <strong>school</strong>'s <strong>listserve</strong> or <strong>LinkedIn</strong> group. Your <strong>LinkedIn</strong> <strong>connections</strong> are a powerful <strong>resource</strong> to leverage. The broader your <strong>network</strong>, the more likely you'll find potential <strong>teammates</strong> with the skill set you're looking for. If you see <strong>someone</strong> you'd like to meet, ask for an <strong>introduction</strong> from a shared contact, even if you're not immediately hiring. As you begin to meet people, be open. Keeping your idea a secret won't get you very far. If you're passionate about your vision, talk about it with the potential teammates you're meeting. You need to know if their <strong>vision</strong> <strong>aligns</strong> with yours. Ideally, they'll bring their own <strong>ideas</strong> about the <strong>product</strong> to the table as well. When building a <strong>founding team</strong>, you're looking for <strong>collaborators</strong>, not <strong>people</strong> who will rely on you to make all of the <strong>decisions</strong> and drive 100<strong>%</strong> of the early development. Once you've connected with potential <strong>teammates</strong>, <strong>work</strong> on some small projects to see if you mesh well together. <strong>Founder</strong> <strong>incompatibility</strong> is one of the most common <strong>reasons</strong> young companies fail. You must discuss the <strong>questions</strong> of <strong>equity</strong> <strong>splits</strong> and <strong>division</strong> of labor as early as possible. Putting it off isn't going to make the conversation any easier. One common <strong>concern</strong> is <strong>commitment</strong> : are both/all <strong>co-founders</strong> quitting their <strong>jobs</strong> to do this full time? Quitting a paying <strong>job</strong> before <strong>funding</strong> is secured is risky, but a <strong>founder</strong> who does so is able to devote 100<strong>%</strong> of his or her <strong>time</strong> and <strong>attention</strong> to <strong>launching</strong> the new company. If one <<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>founder</<strong>s</strong>trong></<strong>s</strong>trong> i<strong>s</strong> working on the <<strong>s</strong>trong><strong>s</strong>tartup</<strong>s</strong>trong> full-time while the other i<strong>s</strong> <strong>s</strong>till at another <<strong>s</strong>trong>paying job</<strong>s</strong>trong>, it i<strong>s</strong> common for the <<strong>s</strong>trong><<strong>s</strong>trong>founder</<strong>s</strong>trong></<strong>s</strong>trong>(<strong>s</strong>) who <strong>took</strong> the ri<strong>s</strong>k to get more of the equity. Your <strong>mentors</strong> 
 <strong>Another</strong> <strong>group</strong> of <strong>people</strong> to reach out to early in the <strong>idea stage</strong> are potential <strong>mentors</strong>. A good <strong>mentor</strong> will offer meaningful <strong>advice</strong> and help you work through challenges. He or she will typically have <strong>experience</strong> in some <strong>facet</strong> of your <strong>market</strong> or business. A <strong>mentor</strong> might have a particular <strong>skill set</strong> (for <strong>example</strong>, a <strong>marketing expert</strong>), deep <strong>domain knowledge</strong> (for <strong>instance</strong>, a <strong>doctor</strong> who specializes in the <strong>ailment</strong> your <strong>device</strong> <strong>remedies</strong>), <strong>years</strong> of <strong>experience</strong>, or valuable <strong>industry</strong> connections. For a first-time <strong>hardware entrepreneur</strong>, <strong>building</strong> a <strong>close relationship</strong> with <strong>someone</strong> who has been through the <strong>process</strong> of <strong>manufacturing</strong> a <strong>product</strong> (and knows the pitfalls to avoid) is invaluable. As is the <strong>case</strong> with fellow <strong>hardwarians</strong>, a <strong>mentor</strong> can also help you reduce <strong>waste</strong> and prevent overburden in your production process. Reaching out to potential mentors can be daunting, particularly if you're doing so via a cold email. <strong>People</strong> with a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>experience</strong> are often in senior <strong>leadership</strong> roles and might seem inaccessible. For most of them, <strong>time</strong> is a valuable <strong>commodity</strong> in short supply. <strong>Therefore</strong>, your <strong>approach</strong> really matters. Telling <strong>someone</strong> you want him to be your <strong>mentor</strong> right off the <strong>bat</strong> is the wrong <strong>approach</strong>; it's like proposing <strong>marriage</strong> on the first date. Strong <strong>mentor</strong> <strong>relationships</strong> develop over time. When you reach out for the first <strong>time</strong>, follow these <strong>pointers</strong>: 
 
 <strong>Keep</strong> the <strong>email</strong> or <strong>message concise</strong> and to the point. Long emails are often ignored, or the recipient postpones reading them until it's convenient. <strong>Tell</strong> the <strong>person</strong> why you're reaching out to them specifically, to avoid the <strong>impression</strong> that your <strong>email</strong> is a mass mailing. Be clear with your ask. <strong>Ask</strong> for <strong>help</strong> with a discrete <strong>question</strong> or clearly defined problem. Ideally, this should be <strong>something</strong> that justifies a personal <strong>response</strong>, rather than an <strong>issue</strong> they have already addressed in a <strong>blog post</strong> or other public <strong>source</strong> of information. <strong>Minimize</strong> <strong>friction</strong> by <strong>offering</strong> to accommodate their <strong>schedule</strong> and preferred <strong>mode</strong> of communication. Some <strong>startup</strong> <strong>founders</strong> choose to formalize an <strong>advisory relationship</strong> and recognize a <strong>mentor</strong>'s <strong>contribution</strong> by <strong>awarding</strong> a small <strong>equity stake</strong> in the company. This should involve a formal <strong>contract</strong>, in which the <strong>founder</strong> and <strong>mentor</strong> agree on the specific <strong>level</strong> of <strong>engagement</strong> that the <strong>mentor</strong> is expected to maintain. Monthly meetings or calls are considered standard. <strong>Strategic</strong> <strong>help</strong>, such as <strong>participation</strong> in <strong>recruiting</strong> or <strong>introduction</strong> to <strong>customers</strong>, or <strong>expert</strong> <strong>value-adds</strong>, such as <strong>work</strong> on a particular <strong>project</strong>, typically increase the <strong>amount</strong> of equity offered. <strong>Do</strong>n't make the <strong>mistake</strong> of <strong>choosing</strong> <strong>advisors</strong> because they are famous and you want their <strong>picture</strong> on a <strong>slide</strong> to <strong>impress</strong> investors. If you're going to give away <strong>part</strong> of your <strong>company</strong> to this <strong>person</strong>, make sure they're doing enough <strong>work</strong> to merit the award. Be sure that your <strong><strong><strong>advisor</strong></strong>y contract</strong> includes <strong>criteria</strong> for <strong>termination</strong> in <strong>case</strong> the <strong>relationship</strong> goes sour and the <strong><strong>advisor</strong></strong> doesn't deliver, or if you pivot into a <strong>space</strong> in which the <strong><strong>advisor</strong></strong>'s <strong>expertise</strong> is no longer relevant. Your <strong><strong>True Believers</strong></strong> and early <strong>community</strong> 
 Your <strong><strong>True Believers</strong></strong> are your earliest evangelists. They're the <strong>people</strong> who <strong>care</strong> enough to actively help you on the <strong>road</strong> to <strong>success</strong>, right from the start. The <strong>core</strong> of this <strong>group</strong> is usually your personal <strong>friends</strong> and family. Gathering your <strong>True Believers</strong> requires taking a close <strong>look</strong> at your personal network. <strong>Start</strong> small: <strong>tell</strong> your <strong>closest</strong> <strong>friends</strong> and <strong>family</strong> what you're doing and <strong>ask</strong> if they'd be interested in regular updates. Then, widen the circle. If you already have a following on social <strong>media channels</strong>, <strong>leverage</strong> it: <strong>tweet</strong>, <strong>post</strong>, drive <strong>friends</strong> and <strong>followers</strong> to a <strong>landing page</strong> with a <strong>forum</strong> or email list signup. <strong>Identify</strong> the <strong>influencers</strong> in your <strong>network</strong> who will likely be interested in your <strong>project</strong>, and reach out to them individually via a dedicated note. Tell them what you're doing and why you're excited about it. There's no magic ideal number of True Believers. However, since one of the <strong>functions</strong> of this <strong>group</strong> is to help you get the <strong>word</strong> out, increasing the <strong>number</strong> of <strong>True Believers</strong> can increase your <strong>reach</strong>, so it's worth <strong>spending time</strong> cultivating these relationships. The more engaged this <strong>group</strong> is, the easier it will be to successfully run a <strong>crowdfunding</strong> or <strong>preorder campaign</strong> down the road. You should start to involve the people with whom you have a strong relationship as early as possible, even if you don't have much to share at first. True <strong>Believers</strong> are a <strong>subset</strong> of a bigger <strong>group</strong>: your early-adopter community. <strong>Communities</strong> typically <strong>form</strong> around <strong>interests</strong>, <strong>practices</strong> (for <strong>instance</strong>, <strong>hobbies</strong> or <strong>professions</strong>), or <strong>location</strong> (geographic proximity). Sometimes, they are working toward a shared <strong>goal</strong> and can be considered <strong>communities</strong> of action. Or, alternatively, they might be bound by shared circumstances, such as sexual orientation. It's important to identify why your <strong>earliest</strong> <strong>adopters</strong> should want to spend their <strong>time</strong> participating in your community. What will they get out of the experience? They are probably interested in your <strong>product</strong>, but they won't want to spend a big <strong>chunk</strong> of their free <strong>time</strong> endlessly discussing something that doesn't exist yet. While <strong>True Believers</strong> <strong>care</strong> about you , the slightly broader early <strong>adopter community</strong> generally <strong>care</strong>s deeply about your space . As a <strong>result</strong>, they're an <strong>excellent source</strong> of unvarnished <strong>feedback</strong> for early idea validation. Getting a new <strong>community</strong> off the <strong>ground</strong> can feel like an insurmountable <strong>obstacle</strong>; it's really hard to build a <strong>group</strong> from nothing. To grow your <strong>community</strong> beyond the <strong>True Believers</strong> who love you, you'll have to put some <strong>effort</strong> into <strong>extending</strong> and strengthening your network. If you don't have a strong <strong>circle</strong> of <strong>contacts</strong>, or have avoided developing a <strong>presence</strong> on popular social <strong>channels</strong>, <strong>consider</strong> putting in a small <strong>amount</strong> of <strong>time</strong> each day to foster one. You don't have to become a social media guru, but having a rich network can only help you. Establish <strong>relationships</strong> by participating in <strong>online</strong> groups. <strong>Post</strong> interesting <strong>content</strong> on <strong>Twitter</strong>, and <strong>engage</strong> with <strong>people</strong> who are commenting or sharing <strong>articles</strong> about your space. <strong>Google</strong> a wide <strong>variety</strong> of <strong>keywords</strong> and <strong>phrases</strong>, see what <strong>blogs</strong> or <strong>sites</strong> exist, and reach out to the authors. <strong>Look</strong> for <strong>in-person</strong> meetups. If you don't find any, set one up. You might find kindred <strong>spirits</strong> in <strong>academia</strong> as well; for <strong>example</strong>, many <strong>universities</strong> have <strong>robotics</strong> and other hardware-focused clubs. Once you've identified a <strong>handful</strong> of potential early <strong>adopters</strong>, it's <strong>time</strong> to facilitate <strong>dialogue</strong> and <strong>begin</strong> turning the <strong>group</strong> into a true community. <strong>Introduce</strong> the <strong>members</strong> to each other and seed a conversation. You're going to have to do the <strong>work</strong> of keeping <strong>conversations</strong> going until there are enough engaged users that it happens organically. Tailor your early content accordingly. To the <strong>extent</strong> that you're comfortable, <strong>talk</strong> about the <strong>development process</strong> you're going through, and <strong>solicit feedback</strong> (again: idea validation!). <strong>Passionate</strong> <strong>community</strong> <strong>members</strong> will enjoy feeling like they're <strong>part</strong> of the process. You should try to maintain a <strong>level</strong> of <strong>excitement</strong> that will keep them evangelizing for you through what is potentially a long <strong>path</strong> to market. <strong>Work</strong> hard to avoid making your <strong>community</strong> <strong>discussions</strong> all about you or your product because that will get boring quickly. <strong>Discuss</strong> the broader <strong>industry</strong> or space. <strong>Share news</strong> <strong>articles</strong> about the underlying <strong>issues</strong> you all care about. <strong>Call</strong> <strong>attention</strong> to the <strong>milestones</strong> or <strong>successes</strong> of the other <strong>members</strong> of the group. Above all, make your <strong>True Believers</strong> and early <strong>adopters</strong> feel valued and heard. <strong>Consider</strong> <strong>offering</strong> special <strong>perks</strong> to show <strong>appreciation</strong>, particularly as you begin to take <strong>pre-orders</strong> or ramp up to a crowdfunding campaign. To keep the <strong>group</strong> growing, <strong>encourage</strong> early <strong>members</strong> to refer trusted <strong>contacts</strong> from their own networks. Reach out to your top <strong>community</strong> <strong>members</strong> individually to ask if there's <strong>anyone</strong> you should invite to participate in the group. Having an invitation-only <strong>model</strong> in the <strong>beginning</strong> can help you control the <strong>size</strong> and <strong>tone</strong> as well as establish <strong>community</strong> norms. As the <strong>group</strong> grows and you no <strong>longer</strong> have to personally drive <strong>engagement</strong>, you can make it public and open and begin to promote it. It's easy to host your <strong>group</strong> using one of the many free <strong>tools</strong> available online. Setting up a <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> <strong>group</strong> is quick and effortless. Creating a <strong>Ning</strong> or blog-based <strong>forum</strong> requires more work, but it's more customizable. It's also likely to rank high in <strong>search</strong> <strong>results</strong>, which can help people to find you. If you have a <strong>project</strong> that will appeal to a very technical or Maker-oriented <strong>audience</strong>, <strong>consider</strong> creating a <strong>forum</strong> on Instructables . Whatever <strong>platform</strong> you choose, make sure it's a <strong>format</strong> that your community is receptive to. Once the <strong>community</strong> is public, be sure to facilitate easy <strong>sharing</strong> of <strong>content</strong> to other <strong>networks</strong>, so that others can discover you.
