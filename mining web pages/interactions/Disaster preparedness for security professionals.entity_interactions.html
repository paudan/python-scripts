    <body>Five <strong>questions</strong> for <strong>Desiree Matel-Anderson</strong>: <strong>Insights</strong> on <strong>FIT’s</strong> three-step <strong>methodology</strong> for <strong>maneuvering</strong> through <strong>cybersecurity</strong> emergencies. I recently sat down with <strong>Desiree Matel-Anderson</strong>, <strong>chief wrangler</strong> of the Field Innovation Team (FIT) and <strong>CEO</strong> of the <strong>Global Disaster Innovation Group</strong>, to discuss <strong>designing</strong> in the <strong>security world</strong> with strengthened <strong>collaboration</strong> during a data breach. Here are some highlights from our talk. 1. As <strong>chief wrangler</strong> at <strong>FIT</strong>, a nonprofit focused on <strong>disaster preparedness</strong> and <strong>crisis</strong>, you see how many different <strong>groups</strong> respond to crises. What are some <strong>patterns</strong> you see in <strong>groups</strong> that successfully maneuver through <strong>emergency</strong> situations? The <strong>patterns</strong> of a successful <strong>emergency response</strong> are clear <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> fostered through simple <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> <strong>frameworks</strong> (<strong>i.e.</strong>, using <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> as the <strong>method</strong> of <strong>problem</strong> solving). An <strong>example</strong> of this is <strong>FIT’s three-step</strong> <strong>prep design process</strong>, which is composed of this basic <strong>approach</strong>: 

 
	 Begin with a narrative of who and what you are solving for. <strong>Sculpt</strong> a focused <strong>challenge statement</strong> through our reframing exercise. Build out one concept to prototype. You begin the <strong>process</strong> with situational <strong>awareness</strong> of a <strong>cybersecurity breach</strong> to emphasize the <strong>importance</strong> of defining the <strong>environment</strong>, discussing with a <strong>team</strong>, and then laying out the <strong>details</strong> before jumping to conclusions. Next, you build on a <strong><strong>c</strong>hallenge statement</strong> defining very spe<strong>c</strong>ifi<strong>c</strong>ally (a<strong>)</strong> who and what <strong>populations</strong> you are planning for, (b<strong>)</strong> whi<strong>c</strong>h fo<strong>c</strong>used <strong>issue</strong> you will address, (<strong>c</strong><strong>)</strong> and why this narrowed target is needed or important. Finally, you ideate and <strong>prototype</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to start <strong>brainstorming</strong> <strong>ideas</strong> for the security breach. This is an <strong>opportunity</strong> to come up with the wildest and most creative <strong><strong>ideas</strong></strong> possible, then ground your <strong><strong>ideas</strong></strong> back to <strong>reality</strong> by <strong>creating</strong> a physical <strong>representation</strong> using the resources around you. <strong>Teams</strong> are then formed to present the <strong><strong>ideas</strong></strong> to <strong>others</strong> to ensure that the <strong>logic</strong> behind the <strong><strong>ideas</strong></strong> is clear to those outside the group. 2. How would FIT’s three-step <strong>methodology</strong> to solve <strong>problems</strong> in <strong>crisis</strong> <strong>situations</strong> apply to a security breach? Our three-step prep design process can be utilized in any crisis situation. I’ll actually be leading our very first simulated <strong>hack</strong> at the O’Reilly <strong>Security Conference</strong> in Amsterdam. <strong>Participants</strong> will be interacting with fellow <strong>security</strong> <strong>professionals</strong> to <strong>practice design</strong> thinking and <strong>learn</strong> how these <strong>concepts</strong> can best be applied during a cyber<strong>security</strong> breach. The <strong>aim</strong> is better on-your-feet <strong>problem</strong> solving and rapid <strong>response</strong> during a security emergency. 3. What are the <strong>benefits</strong> of utilizing <strong>emergency management language</strong> in the <strong>case</strong> of a security breach? <strong>Collaboration</strong> is a <strong>pattern</strong> in <strong>emergency response</strong> that is paramount in all <strong>situations</strong>, including a security breach. It is essential that we all <strong>learn</strong> each <strong>other’s</strong> <strong><strong>language</strong>s</strong> and understand the <strong>systems</strong> of our <strong>partners</strong>, which includes <strong>security</strong> <strong>professionals</strong> having a <strong>foundation</strong> of the <strong>language</strong> and <strong>structure</strong> of <strong>emergency management</strong> to support rapid response. 4. What <strong><strong>principles</strong></strong> define design-thinking <strong>methodology</strong>, and how do those <strong><strong>principles</strong></strong> apply to security? Design-thinking <strong>methodology</strong> is all about the end-user <strong>driving</strong> us towards empathy and placing <strong>ourselves</strong> in the <strong>shoes</strong> of the person impacted. By <strong>putting</strong> together creative <strong><strong>solutions</strong></strong> that drive <strong>impact</strong> for the end-user in the <strong>security field and/or</strong> any <strong>situation</strong> where <strong><strong>challenges</strong></strong> arise, you will have the three-step <strong>prep framework</strong> as a <strong>tool</strong> to build progressive <strong><strong>solutions</strong></strong> that you would not have believed possible and further drive an <strong>understanding</strong> of the <strong>cyber world</strong> around us and/or the other <strong><strong>challenges</strong></strong> we may face in our day-to-day activities. 5. As you mentioned, you're leading an interactive <strong>exercise</strong> on <strong>designing</strong> for <strong>cyber-security</strong> <strong>solutions</strong> at the O’Reilly <strong>Security Conference</strong> in <strong>Amsterdam</strong> this November. What presentations are you looking forward to attending while there? The <strong>presentations</strong> I am looking forward to attending are Google’s <strong>Allison Miller</strong> who has expertise in <strong>designing</strong> and implementing real-time <strong>risk prevention</strong> <strong>systems</strong> at <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>O’Reilly’s Courtney Nash</strong> who has a <strong>background</strong> in <strong>neuroscience</strong> and has focused on <strong>examining</strong> the <strong>way</strong> our <strong>brains</strong> interact with technology. Both of these <strong>women</strong> have fascinating <strong>backgrounds</strong> and a <strong>plethora</strong> of experience. I can’t wait to see them live! <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> <strong>Disaster</strong> <strong>preparedness</strong> for <strong>security</strong> professionals.</body>
