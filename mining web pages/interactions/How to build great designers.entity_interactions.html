    <body>5 <strong>questions</strong> for <strong>Ryan Noon</strong>: Why your <strong>company</strong> needs a <strong>maker space</strong>, <strong>finding inspiration</strong> out the <strong>window</strong>, and what <strong>designers</strong> and elite athletes have in common. I recently asked <strong>Ryan Noon</strong> , <strong><strong>design</strong>er</strong> at <strong>Nike</strong>, to discuss his <strong>journey</strong> into <strong>design</strong>, making, and the <strong>power</strong> of looking beyond the screen. At the O’Reilly <strong>Design Conference</strong>, <strong>Noon</strong> will be participating in a <strong>panel</strong>, <strong>Creating Space</strong> for <strong>Making</strong> in the <strong>Workplace</strong> , with <strong>Patrick Chew</strong> of <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>Alexandra Williams</strong> of <strong>Airbnb</strong>, and <strong>Tim Belonax</strong> of Pinterest. What do you do at Nike? I run the Blue Ribbon Studio (BRS), which is our internal <strong>maker space</strong>, think <strong>tank</strong>, and <strong>school</strong> for Nike Design. I have a <strong>background</strong> in <strong>design</strong> and art—where I’ve worked for <strong>Alexander McQueen</strong>, <strong>Henrik Vibskov</strong>, and run my own <strong>collection</strong>, Ryan Noon . I came to <strong>Nike</strong> to work in <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> initially on <strong>apparel</strong>, then prints, than graphic <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> before I started the BRS. <strong>BRS</strong> is a <strong>design studio</strong> / <strong>maker space</strong> within the <strong>company</strong> that is open to the <strong>members</strong> of Nike Design. <strong>Within</strong> it are various <strong>studios</strong> that <strong>designers</strong> can think, prototype, create, explore, and play. We also run a <strong>BRS Academy</strong> within the <strong>space</strong>, which <strong>teaches</strong> everything from <strong>Laser Cutting</strong> 101 to <strong>Ikebana</strong> to <strong>Stonewashing</strong> to Sign Painting. Our <strong>goal</strong> is to invest in our <strong>amazing design <strong>talent</strong>—like</strong> any <strong>elite athlete</strong>, you need to <strong>practice</strong> and train to keep up your <strong>skill</strong> and <strong>talent</strong>; we feel the same about design. My <strong>background</strong> in <strong>fashion</strong> and working in various <strong>studios</strong> has all funneled into what I do today. My <strong>background</strong> in various <strong>fields</strong> from <strong>fashion</strong>, to print, to <strong>graphics</strong>, to running my own <strong>company</strong>, to growing up building and working with <strong>power</strong> <strong>tools</strong> have all helped bring <strong>life</strong> to the <strong>studio</strong>, as it encompasses  many disciplines. <strong>It’s<<strong>/</strong>strong> a global <strong>/</strong> local <strong>studio</strong>, too—we <strong>love</strong> the creative <strong>community</strong> and want to make sure we have perspective from all around the world. You are a fashion designer by training. How did you find your way into the design world, and when did you know this was what you wanted to do? I was interested in all things art and design early on. I was into <strong>architecture</strong> first, then sailboat <strong>design</strong>, then <strong>fine art</strong>, and ended up studying fashion <strong>design</strong> and print at <strong>Central Saint Martins</strong>, in London. It was a great <strong>mix</strong> of <strong>design</strong> through <strong>fashion</strong> and <strong>art</strong>, through <strong>design</strong>ing <strong>prints</strong> for the body. I used to go to visit my <strong>aunts</strong> in <strong>NYC</strong> during the <strong>summers</strong> who worked in <strong>design</strong> and <strong>hang</strong> out in the color <strong>design</strong> department and take <strong>drawing</strong> <strong>classes</strong> at Parsons. In <strong>New York</strong>, I also met with <strong>designer</strong> and <strong>artist</strong> <strong>Susan Cianciolo</strong>, who is a <strong>family friend</strong>; I was so inspired by her <strong>DIY</strong> and punk spirit of doing and making. You’re <strong>giving</strong> a <strong>talk</strong> with like minded <strong>designers</strong> from <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>Airbnb</strong>, and <strong>Pinterest</strong> on creating <strong>space</strong> for making in the workplace. Why do you think it's important to offer this opportunity to employees? Being hands on is where the magic happens. <strong>Ideas</strong> don’t only come out on <strong>paper</strong> or through a <strong>laptop</strong>, but by making <strong>mistakes</strong>, experimenting, and talking to other people. Being in an energetic <strong>space</strong> with a <strong>diversity</strong> of <strong>disciplines</strong> adds to better <strong>product</strong> and ideas. What makes for a good <strong>designer</strong> in this <strong>day</strong> and age? <strong>Curiosity</strong>, <strong>hunger</strong>, self-initiative, <strong>knowledge</strong> of the future and the past. For me, not <strong>look</strong>ing at a <strong>screen</strong> is key—when you’re in a <strong>taxi</strong>, <strong>look</strong> out the <strong>window</strong>; on the <strong>sub<strong>way</strong></strong>, see how <strong>people</strong> wear <strong>clothes—it’s</strong> <strong>way</strong> more inspiring than a blog. It’s important to think for yourself! <strong>Everything online</strong> has been (my least favorite <strong>word</strong>) “curated,” and it’s hard to <strong>form</strong> your own <strong>opinions</strong> from that much curation. There is <strong>inspiration</strong> in <strong>everyday</strong> <strong>things</strong> all around us—it’s a positive <strong>attitude</strong> and outlook that makes them exciting. Alchemy everywhere! You're speaking at the O'Reilly Design Conference in March. What sessions are you interested in attending? At a <strong>conference</strong> or <strong>festival</strong> I like to be surprised, I don’t usually read up too much and like to see as much as I can and wander into and <strong>experience</strong> all new things. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> How to build great designers.</body>
