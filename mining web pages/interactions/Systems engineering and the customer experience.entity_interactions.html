    <body>Five <strong>questions</strong> for <strong>Caskey Dickson</strong>: <strong>Insights</strong> on the changing role of IT ops. I recently sat down with <strong>Caskey Dickson</strong>, site <strong>reliability engineer</strong> and <strong>software engineer</strong> at <strong>Microsoft</strong>, to discuss the <strong>importance</strong> of strategic <strong>metrics</strong>, maximizing the <strong>customer experience</strong>, and how the <strong>role</strong> of operations is changing. Here are some highlights from our talk. 1. Why is it so important to think strategically about metrics? <strong>Metrics</strong> are the <strong>windows</strong> into the <strong>health</strong> and behavior of your service. Without the <strong>right</strong> <strong>metrics</strong> you won’t know what is going on or how to fix it. <strong>Furthermore</strong>, having <strong>metrics</strong> of the appropriate <strong>resolution</strong> and granularity is needed. If you only know a metric’s <strong>average</strong> fleet-wide then you have no <strong>idea</strong> if there are particular <strong>server</strong> <strong>instances</strong> that are failing your users. <strong>Can</strong> you tell the <strong>difference</strong> in <strong>error</strong> <strong>rates</strong> and <strong>latency</strong> broken down not just by <strong>server</strong> but by software revision? Having the <strong>right</strong> <strong>metrics</strong> presented in the <strong>right</strong> way provides a <strong>smoking gun</strong> that drives down <strong>TTD</strong> (<strong><strong>time</strong></strong> to detect) and <strong>TTM (</strong><strong><strong>time</strong></strong> to mitigate) for the <strong>benefit</strong> of your customers. <strong>Peace</strong> of <strong>mind</strong> is just a bonus. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> <strong>Systems</strong> <strong>engineering</strong> and the customer experience.</body>
