    <body>Is it possible for an AI to create revolutionary art? With the <strong>progress</strong> we've seen in artificial <strong>intelligence</strong> over the past <strong>year</strong>, there's been a <strong>lot</strong> of excited <strong>talk</strong> about <strong>AI</strong> and creativity. <strong>Can</strong> we make <strong>AI</strong> systems that are creative? And what does that mean? We've seen <strong>AIs</strong> that can write relatively formulaic <strong>newspaper</strong> <strong>stories</strong>, paint new Dutch <strong>Masters</strong> , apply <strong>Van Gogh</strong>'s <strong>style</strong> to arbitrary <strong>pictures</strong> , and and play Go brilliantly . But is that creativity? As the clich√©d question goes, "Is it art?" <strong>Questions</strong> about <strong>creativity</strong> are tough because we don't really know what "<strong>creativity</strong>" is. We have <strong>industries</strong> devoted to the <strong>production</strong> of formulaic <strong>pieces</strong> for mass consumption. We talk about the "<strong>movie <strong>industry</strong></strong>" and the "music <strong>industry</strong>," and those <strong>terms</strong> are absolutely right, because while <strong>movies</strong> and music are undeniably creative at some <strong>level</strong>, the <strong>industries</strong> are primarily about pushing out a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>product</strong> and getting people to buy it. This <strong><strong>year</strong></strong>'s "the same" isn't exactly the same as last <strong><strong>year</strong></strong>'s "the same," but <strong>art</strong> that's produced and marketed for <strong>mass consumption</strong> can't afford to be too different or strange. On the other <strong>hand</strong>, we have a <strong>notion</strong> that an <strong>artist</strong> is <strong><strong>someone</strong></strong> who creates taste rather than <strong>reflects</strong> it, <strong><strong>someone</strong></strong> who breaks the <strong>rules</strong>, who creates <strong>things</strong> of a kind that didn't exist before. These are the artists who create radical art. It's worth <strong>looking</strong> at a radically creative <strong>artist</strong> to see what this fuss is about. As a classical <strong>pianist</strong>, I'll choose <strong>Beethoven</strong>, who was probably the most radical <strong>composer</strong> in the history of music. What made <strong>Beethoven</strong> <strong>unique</strong> in the first place? Could a computer create music that's equally groundbreaking? <strong>Everybody</strong> is familiar with <strong>Beethoven</strong>'s 5th <strong>symphony</strong>, and that's the problem: we're so familiar with it that we've forgotten how strangely it starts. The first <strong>movement</strong> is built entirely from a <strong>theme</strong> that's really just a four-note fragment. Da-da-da-DUH. Then those four notes again, in another key. And again, and again, and again. Where are you going to go with that? This is not Papa Haydn. <strong>Likewise</strong>, the <strong>Waldstein</strong> <strong>piano sonata</strong> has a 20 <strong>note theme</strong> , in which the first <strong>chord</strong> (<strong>C</strong> major<strong>)</strong> is repeated 16 times. Then the same chord again, but in another key. What's going on? Beethoven frequently takes a relatively uninteresting <strong>tune</strong>, breaks it down into tiny <strong>pieces</strong>, and <strong>reassembles</strong> it in amazing ways. What's he doing? He was never as good with a <strong>melody</strong> as <strong>Mozart</strong>; is he working from his weakness? Is he turning his deafness into an advantage? Maybe it's not surprising that a <strong>composer</strong> who was going <strong>deaf</strong> would start a <strong>piece</strong> by <strong>pounding</strong> out the same chord repeatedly. It's certainly no <strong>surprise</strong> that many of <strong>Beethoven</strong>'s <strong>contemporaries</strong> considered this noise. The <strong>Opus</strong> 110 <strong>piano sonata</strong> is one of <strong>Beethoven</strong>'s late masterpieces. Like most piano sonatas, it looks like it has three movements. But does it? The second movement really moves straight ahead into the third, without a break . The so-called third <strong>movement</strong> starts with a long <strong>bridge</strong> that <strong>nobody</strong> knows how to play (the <strong>notation</strong> in <strong>measures</strong> four and five doesn't make <strong>sense</strong>) into a lament. Then in <strong>measure</strong> 27, the <strong>lament</strong> suddenly becomes a <strong>fugue</strong> , also without a break. Then the <strong>lament</strong> comes back in the <strong>middle</strong> of <strong>measure</strong> 114; the <strong>fugue</strong> comes back in 137, with the <strong>theme</strong> turned upside down; and then all the <strong>parts</strong> <strong>scatter</strong> around in <strong>strange</strong>, uncoordinated <strong>ways</strong> to introduce a final <strong>section</strong> based on the <strong>fugue</strong> <strong>theme</strong>, but with big <strong>chords</strong> above a moving bass line. So: is this two, three, four, five, or six movements? I can't <strong>answer</strong> that <strong>question</strong>; there isn't an <strong>answer</strong>, and that's the point. Beethoven has turned the traditional sonata form into a problem. He's taken it as far as it can go, and moved way, way beyond it. He broke it, and has done something profoundly new. It wouldn't surprise me at all if an <strong>AI</strong> trained on <strong><strong>Beethoven</strong></strong>'s <strong>works</strong> could "write" synthetic <strong><strong>Beethoven</strong></strong> symphonies or piano sonatas. I'm sure an <strong>AI</strong> would be good at breaking a larger <strong>theme</strong> up into <strong>parts</strong> and reassembling them in <strong>clever</strong> ways. It could certainly pick up characteristic <strong>gestures</strong>, like suddenly moving from <strong>fortissimo</strong> to pianissimo, or using the <strong>extreme</strong> ends of the <strong>piano</strong>'s range. But the <strong>ability</strong> of <strong>AI</strong> to imitate isn't really the question. Imitation has never been all that hard. If you trained an <strong>AI</strong> with the entire <strong>body</strong> of Western <strong>music</strong> prior to <strong>Beethoven</strong>'s birth in 1770, could it come up with something equally radical? Or, if you had all the <strong>music</strong> up until 1960, would you get <strong>Hendrix</strong>, the <strong>Beatles</strong>, and Zappa? All of these <strong><strong>music</strong>ians</strong> were working out of <strong>traditions</strong> and <strong>styles</strong> that came before, whether the high classical <strong>music</strong> of <strong>Mozart</strong> and <strong>Haydn</strong>, or the <strong>blues</strong> of <strong>Leadbelly</strong> and Blind Lemon Jefferson. But they also took those earlier <strong>traditions</strong>, <strong>broke</strong> them <strong>apart</strong>, and built something new and different. But whether an <strong>AI</strong> can push an artistic <strong>tradition</strong> to a new <strong>level</strong> is only the <strong>start</strong> of the problem. <strong>Art</strong> is ultimately about <strong><strong>humans</strong></strong>: even if <strong><strong>humans</strong></strong> don't create it, they're the <strong>ones</strong> who look at it, listen to it, and decide whether or not they like it. With that in <strong>mind</strong>, it's worth <strong>thinking</strong> about the <strong>reception</strong> of any radical art. There's a common <strong>pattern</strong>: early on, a few <strong>cognoscenti love</strong> it, but the masses find it too difficult and hate it. Years or decades later, we worship it; then we find it boring. <strong>Chuck Berry</strong>'s "<strong>Roll</strong> over, <strong><strong>Beethoven</strong></strong>" is ironically good <strong>commentary</strong> on this <strong>process</strong>: <strong><strong>Beethoven</strong></strong> became boring precisely because he was <strong>worship</strong>ped, and that <strong>worship</strong> transformed <strong>performances</strong> into <strong>stodgy</strong>, <strong>grandiose</strong> <strong>parodies</strong> of "great art." But there's nothing unique about Beethoven. Talking about the <strong>decline</strong> of the music <strong>industry</strong>, <strong>Frank Zappa</strong> says : 
 One <strong>thing</strong> that did happen during the 60s was some music of an unusual or experimental nature did get recorded or did get released. Now look at who the <strong>executives</strong> were in those <strong>companies</strong> at those times. Not hip young guys. These were cigar-chomping old <strong>guys</strong> who looked at the <strong>product</strong> that came and said, 'I don't know. Who knows what it is. Record it. Stick it out. If it sells, alright.' We were better off with those <strong>guys</strong> than we are now with the supposedly <strong>hip</strong> young <strong>executives</strong> who are making the <strong>decisions</strong> of what <strong>people</strong> should see and hear in the marketplace. We were lucky to get the <strong>Beatles</strong>; if the <strong>record</strong> execs hadn't said, "I don't get it. What the hell. ", music would have taken a different course. Beethoven survived because, frankly, he was one of the biggest <strong>assholes</strong> in <strong>history</strong>, and nobody was going to tell him what to do. He had his <strong>fans</strong> amoung the <strong>avant garde</strong>, of <strong>course</strong>, but he certainly wasn't easy <strong>listening</strong> for your typical concertgoer. And he didn't care. Now we're at the <strong>heart</strong> of the <strong>problem</strong> of <strong>AI</strong> creativity. You can talk as much as you like about automating creativity, but the human is never out of the loop. At some <strong>point</strong>, <strong>humans</strong> have to look at <strong>whatever art</strong> <strong>works</strong> <strong>AI</strong> produces and decide whether they want more. That's not a technical requirement; it's a human one. If humans don't like it, they'll pull the plug. What <strong>happens</strong> to the <strong>algorithms</strong> when the <strong>listeners</strong> turn <strong>thumbs</strong> up or <strong>thumbs</strong> down? <strong>Will Spotify</strong> and <strong>Pandora (</strong>or, more precisely, their <strong>algorithms</strong>) take <strong>risks</strong> on challenging music? Or will the <strong>AI</strong>'s <strong>managers</strong> tweak the <strong>algorithm</strong> and <strong>retrain</strong> until the results are more marketable? If an <strong>AI</strong> wrote the 5th <strong>symphony</strong>, would a music <strong>exec say</strong> "pretty good, could be better, let's tweak the <strong>model</strong> and get <strong>something</strong> people will really like"? It won't make a <strong>difference</strong> if the <strong>AI</strong> has a Beethoven-like ego. It won't have the ability to forge ahead regardless of what contemporaries think. It will be at the <strong>mercy</strong> of <strong>record</strong> <strong>execs</strong> and <strong>program</strong> <strong>managers</strong> who aren't likely to say "Who knows what it is... if it sells, alright." Best <strong>case</strong>, we'll end up with occasional <strong>bits</strong> of <strong>brilliance</strong> sprinkled through <strong>yottabytes</strong> of unwanted <strong>music</strong> in cold storage. And <strong>nobody</strong> will have the <strong>time</strong> or patience to go through it. There's a deeper point here. Is it important that this art was created by humans? With music, you could argue that we only want something to entertain us. There is certainly <strong>room</strong> for music-as-product; you need <strong>something</strong> to listen to in elevators. And you could even argue that when you're listening to or performing Beethoven, you don't care where the music came from. But there are art forms for which that isn't true. Earlier this <strong>year</strong>, the <strong>Guardian</strong> published an <strong>article</strong> about <strong>computers</strong> writing poetry . Although these <strong>attempts</strong> were laughably bad <strong>(</strong>the <strong>Guardian</strong> called it <strong>Vogon Poetry )</strong>, we can assume that future <strong>attempts</strong> will be much better. But why is poetry important to us? Is it because it's a <strong>pleasing arrangement</strong> of <strong>words</strong>, or is it precisely because a human created those <strong>words</strong>? <strong>Music</strong> can be <strong>Muzak</strong>, but there's no poetic <strong>equivalent</strong>, except perhaps greeting card verse. Greeting cards can be written by AI: I really don't care. But I don't think I'd care about the <strong>poems</strong> of <strong>Keats</strong> or the <strong>plays</strong> of Shakespeare if they hadn't been written by a human. If <strong>Keats</strong>' <strong>Bright Star</strong> were just a <strong>pleasing arrangement</strong> of <strong>words</strong> coming out of a carefully tuned neural network, would we be interested in them? I don't think so. By the same <strong>token</strong>, I don't at all <strong>see</strong> why we need <strong>imitation</strong> <strong>Rembrandts</strong> or Van Goghs. <strong>Yes</strong>, there is a <strong>market</strong> for <strong>Elvis</strong> on <strong>Velvet</strong>, and perhaps even <strong>paintings</strong> in <strong>doctors</strong>' offices. But <strong>art</strong> as <strong>product</strong> gets boring quickly. While I'm sure that <strong><strong><strong>AI</strong></strong></strong> <strong>systems</strong> can produce an <strong>endless stream</strong> of <strong>pop</strong> <strong>songs</strong>, fake Dutch <strong>Masters</strong>, and sentimental <strong>poetry</strong>, and while <strong><strong><strong>AI</strong></strong></strong> may even be able to reproduce the relatively minor <strong>changes</strong> that go from <strong>period</strong> to the next, I don't think it's likely that <strong><strong><strong>AI</strong></strong></strong> will be able to produce revolutionary art. Could <strong>AI</strong> produce the next <strong><strong>Beethoven</strong></strong>, or the next <strong>Beatles</strong>, as opposed to just synthetic <strong><strong>Beethoven</strong></strong> or <strong>Beatles</strong>? I'm not saying that it can't, but that's a qualitatively different, and much more difficult, problem. At <strong>ZeitGeist</strong>, <strong>Mark Rumsen (</strong>as tweeted by Tim O'Reilly) said that "<strong>Anyone</strong> who says they can tell you what the <strong>future</strong> of music is is either lying, or they are from the <strong>future</strong>." I certainly can't predict the future of music, or of any other art form. But neither can an artificial intelligence. I'm confident that great <strong>art</strong> will continue to break <strong>rules</strong> and leap out in <strong>front</strong> of human cognition. It will be about breaking with established norms and making something new. Making those <strong>leaps</strong> will be difficult <strong>(</strong>though <strong>maybe</strong> not impossible<strong>)</strong> for an AI. But appreciating and understanding those <strong>leaps</strong> will be even more difficult for the <strong>humans</strong> who ultimately have to decide whether to let the AI continue creating. <strong>Nobody</strong> pulled <strong>Beethoven</strong>'s plug. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> <strong>Artificial</strong> creativity.</body>
