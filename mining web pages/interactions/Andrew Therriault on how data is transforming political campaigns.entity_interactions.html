He was previously <strong>director</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>science</strong> for the Democratic <strong>National Committee</strong> and is the <strong>editor</strong> of a free O’Reilly <strong>ebook</strong> called “ <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Democracy</strong>: How Political <strong>Data</strong> Science is <strong>Shaping</strong> the 2016 <strong>Elections</strong> .” We talk about how <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> is changing today’s political <strong>campaigns</strong>—particularly the <strong>way</strong> that <strong>campaigns</strong> now determine which potential <strong>supporters</strong> to target with <strong>phone</strong> <strong>calls</strong>, <strong>mailings</strong>, and door-to-door contact. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> <strong>Andrew Therriault</strong> on how <strong>data</strong> is transforming political campaigns.</body>
