    <body>Five <strong>questions</strong> for Rafał <strong>Kuć</strong>: <strong>Insights</strong> on what <strong>sets</strong> the <strong>ELK</strong> <strong>stack apart</strong> from other <strong>log management</strong> <strong>solutions</strong>, common <strong>user</strong> <strong>pitfalls</strong>, and tips for getting started. I recently sat down with Rafał <strong>Kuć</strong>, <strong>search consultant</strong> and <strong>software engineer</strong> at <strong>Sematext Group</strong>, to discuss the <strong>benefits</strong> and common <strong>pitfalls</strong> of using the <strong>ELK</strong> <strong>stack</strong> to <strong>manage</strong> logs. Here are some highlights from our talk. 1. What is the ELK stack? <strong>ELK</strong> stands for <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, <strong>Logstash</strong> and Kibana. The <strong>trio</strong>, which was once separate, joined together to give <strong>users</strong> the <strong>ability</strong> to run <strong>log analysis</strong> on top of open sourced <strong>software</strong> that everyone can run for free. <strong>Elastic<strong>search</strong></strong> is the <strong>search</strong> and analysis system. It is the <strong>place</strong> where your <strong>data</strong> is finally stored, from where it is fetched, and is responsible for <strong>providing</strong> all the <strong>search</strong> and <strong>analysis</strong> results. <strong>Logstash</strong>, which is in the <strong>front</strong>, is responsible for <strong>giving structure</strong> to your <strong>data</strong> (like <strong>parsing</strong> unstructured <strong>logs</strong>) and sending it to Elasticsearch. <strong>Kibana</strong> allows you to build pretty <strong>graphs</strong> and <strong>dashboards</strong> to help <strong>understand</strong> the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> so you don’t have to work with the <strong>raw</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> returns. It doesn't matter if you are running a modest <strong>company</strong> producing small mobile <strong>games</strong> or a large <strong>enterprise—ELK</strong> can come in <strong>handy</strong> when you need time-based <strong>data</strong> analysis. 2. Why is it so useful for dealing with logs? And what makes it different from other solutions for managing logs? Visibility is the key here. Having <strong>hundreds</strong> of <strong>servers</strong> running different <strong>applications</strong>, virtual <strong>machines</strong>, containers—all that adds up to a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>data</strong> that needs to be analyzed when <strong>problems</strong> happen or when you need to understand how things work. Being able to narrow down your <strong>data</strong> or easily find the <strong>information</strong> you are looking for really helps with operations-related tasks. Adding <strong>metrics</strong> to the <strong>equation</strong> gives you even more <strong>visibility</strong> compared to logs only. When you see your <strong>metrics</strong> correlated to <strong>logs</strong> you have the full picture—not only of what is happening now, but also about the <strong>history</strong> and how your <strong>software</strong> pieces were behaving. I think there are two main things that make ELK so popular and different. <strong>First</strong>, <strong>it’s</strong> <strong>simple</strong> to use and is very <strong>DevOps</strong> friendly—especially the <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> <strong>part</strong>; <strong>it’s</strong> manageable with a great <strong>rest</strong> <strong>API</strong> and easy setup. Second is the pricing. If you are a small <strong>company</strong>, want to build <strong>things</strong> in <strong>house</strong>, and can’t <strong>afford enterprise-level log analysis</strong> <strong>solutions</strong>, <strong>ELK</strong> is great—if, of <strong>course</strong>, you can pay the price of managing it yourself. 3. What do <strong>people</strong> often get wrong with the <strong>ELK</strong> stack? We see a <strong>variety</strong> of <strong>problems</strong> when we help <strong>clients</strong> at Sematext. Every <strong>case</strong> is different, and it is very dependant on the <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>experience</strong> of the user. Those who just started their <strong>adventure</strong> with <strong>logs</strong> usually run into <strong>data</strong> structure <strong>problems</strong>, so-called <strong>mappings</strong> in Elasticsearch. <strong>Mappings</strong> define what <strong>fields</strong> are there in your <strong>documents</strong> and what the <strong>behavior</strong> of the <strong>fields</strong> is. Depending on the field configuration, it can or can't be used with certain functionalities. <strong>(</strong>For <strong>example</strong>, a numeric <strong>field</strong> can be used for <strong>range aggregation</strong>, which can divide our <strong>search system query</strong> <strong>logs</strong> by their latency—like <strong>queries</strong> that were running up to 10 milliseconds, from 11 to 100 and so on. You can't do that on text data.) More advanced <strong>users</strong> often run into scaling- and performance-related <strong>problems</strong>, like how to use the <strong>hardware</strong> in the most efficient <strong><strong>way</strong></strong>, how many <strong>servers</strong> to have, whether their <strong>setup</strong> is really the best <strong><strong>way</strong></strong> to approach their problem, and so on. 4. What's the best <strong>way</strong> to get started using the <strong>ELK</strong> <strong>stack</strong> with your infrastructure? Just start using it, really. There are lots of good tutorials on how to begin. And you don't even need to start with tens of servers to see how useful it will be for you. If your <strong>logs</strong> are not standard, <strong>get</strong> an <strong>example</strong>, like <strong>Apache (</strong>very known, very simple to work), and just run <strong>Logstash</strong>, put your <strong>data</strong> to <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> and start <strong>building</strong> your <strong>visualizations</strong> using Kibana. It may not be easy to build complicated dashboards initially, but the more practice you have, the easier it gets. Just start. 5. You're speaking at the <strong>Velocity Conference</strong> in <strong>Amsterdam</strong> this November. What presentations are you looking forward to attending while there? There are multiple <strong>talks</strong> I would like to attend, especially related to <strong>container orchestration</strong>, <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong>, monitoring, and <strong>understanding</strong> data. <strong>Examples</strong> of <strong>talks</strong> I can't wait to attend are " How <strong>humans</strong> see <strong>data</strong> " by <strong>John Rauser</strong> from <strong>Snapchat</strong>, and " <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and <strong>Prometheus</strong>: The <strong>beginning</strong> of a beautiful <strong>friendship</strong> " by Björn <strong>Rabenstein</strong> from SoundCloud. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> <strong>Understanding</strong> the <strong>ELK</strong> stack.</body>
