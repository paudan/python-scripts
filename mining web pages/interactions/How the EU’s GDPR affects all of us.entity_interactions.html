    <body>Five <strong>questions</strong> for <strong>Chiara Rustici</strong>: <strong>Insights</strong> on the global <strong>impact</strong> of the new <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong>, and how to get started with implementation. I recently sat down with <strong>Chiara Rustici</strong>, General Data Protection Regulation (<strong>GDPR</strong>) <strong>expert</strong> and independent <strong>consultant</strong> and <strong>analyst</strong>, to discuss the <strong>EU’s</strong> new <strong>GDPR</strong> <strong>requirements</strong> and their <strong>impact</strong> on organizations worldwide. Here are some highlights from our talk. 1. Could you provide some <strong>context</strong> on the <strong>GDPR</strong> for readers who aren’t familiar with it? This is a new legal <strong>framework</strong> for <strong>handling</strong> personal <strong>data</strong> of EU-based <strong>individuals</strong>, be they <strong>customers</strong>, <strong>prospects</strong>, <strong>contractors</strong> or employees. It is already in <strong>force</strong> but not yet en<strong>force</strong>able—businesses and not-for <strong>profit</strong> <strong>organizations</strong> have until May 25, 2018 to prepare. Although <strong><strong>GDPR</strong></strong> <strong>originates</strong> in the <strong><strong><strong>EU</strong></strong></strong>, it actually impacts <strong><strong>business</strong>es</strong> worldwide: If they handle personal <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> of <strong><strong><strong>EU</strong></strong></strong> <strong>individuals</strong>, or do <strong>business</strong> with <strong>organizations</strong> that do, the <strong><strong>GDPR</strong></strong> imposes <strong>obligations</strong> on how that <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> is treated, even if that personal <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> has traveled outside the <strong><strong><strong>EU</strong></strong></strong> and is now stored and handled in a distant <strong>corner</strong> of the world. 2. What are the broad <strong>sweeping</strong> <strong>implications</strong> of the <strong>GDPR</strong> for organizations? One new legal <strong>requirement</strong> is to report a personal <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>breach</strong> within 72 <strong>hours</strong> of becoming aware of it, both to <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>protection supervisory</strong> <strong>authorities</strong> and to the <strong>individuals</strong> themselves if the <strong>breach</strong> significantly affects their rights. This <strong>requirement</strong> is made more daunting by the <strong>fact</strong> that the <strong>GDPR</strong> expands the <strong>definition</strong> of personal <strong>data</strong> to include any <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> that has even the potential , alone or in <strong>conjunction</strong> with other <strong><strong>information</strong></strong>, to identify a person. To comply with <strong>GDPR</strong>, there are three key <strong>areas</strong> where <strong>businesses</strong> and <strong>software</strong> <strong>architects</strong> need to do things differently. They need to find a <strong>way</strong> to: 

 
	 
 <strong>Preserve</strong> the <strong>identity</strong> of an <strong>individual</strong> across the <strong>multitude</strong> of their different <strong>descriptions</strong>, names and <strong>properties</strong>, and keep these together under one heading. Building a personal <strong>data</strong> <strong>ontology</strong> is a huge <strong>undertaking</strong>, and the <strong>GDPR</strong> adds <strong>complexity</strong> to the <strong>task</strong> by <strong>requiring</strong> that all the <strong>disparate</strong> <strong>data</strong> points that can potentially identify a single individual be included. <strong>Preserve</strong> the <strong>link</strong> between a <strong>data point</strong> and the individual that <strong>data point</strong> can potentially identify. This is either because you need to preserve a <strong>consent chain</strong>, or because you need to advise the individual when the <strong>purpose</strong> for <strong>handling</strong> a particular <strong>data</strong> <strong>point</strong> changes. Attach a <strong>sunset <strong>clause</strong></strong> / <strong>purpose</strong> achieved <strong>clause</strong> to personal data points. Personal data should only be employed for a specific purpose. Once that <strong>purpose</strong> is superseded, the <strong>data</strong> <strong>point</strong> in <strong>question</strong> should no longer be held by the business. <strong>Business</strong> <strong>applications</strong> are not equipped with automatic <strong>erasure</strong> <strong>options</strong> at the person-centric <strong>level</strong> of granularity. <strong>New</strong> <strong>thinking</strong> is needed to figure out, for <strong>example</strong>, how to deal with a file that <strong>contains</strong> <strong>person</strong>al <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> of <strong>multiple</strong> <strong>individuals</strong> when your <strong>purpose</strong> for <strong>handling</strong> the <strong>person</strong>al <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> has “expired” for one <strong>person</strong> but not for the others. 3. How would you recommend an organization begin preparing for the GDPR? What are the first steps? The <strong>GDPR</strong> is, in <strong><strong>business</strong></strong> <strong>terms</strong>, a cost/benefit <strong>analysis exercise</strong>: It asks <strong>organizations</strong> to make <strong>choices</strong> about what they want out of the personal <strong>data</strong> they collect and what they are prepared to do or stop doing in <strong>order</strong> to pursue their <strong><strong>business</strong></strong> <strong>goals</strong> in a lawful manner. In no <strong>way</strong> can IT professionals <strong>start</strong> the <strong>GDPR</strong> <strong>compliance journey</strong> on their own, but they will need to get involved in <strong>business strategy</strong> <strong>conversations</strong>, asking “why?” quite a <strong>lot</strong>: 

 
	 Why exactly are we archiving this data instead of just erasing it? Why are we building this data lake? Why are we allowing the <strong>design</strong> of this <strong>app</strong> to collect these <strong>categories</strong> of personal information? They need to escalate to the <strong>board</strong> and <strong>CEO</strong> the key <strong>data</strong> <strong>business model</strong> <strong>questions</strong>: 

 
	 What are we trying to achieve with these personal <strong>data</strong> sets? <strong>Are</strong> the expected financial <strong>gains</strong> higher than the <strong>costs</strong> of encrypting or de-identifying the sets? Ultimately, the key <strong>preparation stage</strong> is a thorough <strong><strong>business</strong> review</strong> of the <strong>privacy landscape</strong>; some data-driven <strong>business</strong> <strong>models</strong> will no longer be viable in a <strong>GDPR</strong> world. This is a non-negotiable boardroom-level privacy posture call. <strong>Security</strong> <strong>professionals</strong> know too well that not storing personal <strong>data</strong> is the ultimate <strong>security strategy</strong> for this very hazardous <strong>asset</strong>; now the <strong>GDPR</strong> offers them powerful legal <strong>grounds</strong> to impose a <strong>limit</strong> on <strong>collection</strong> and storage. 4. What <strong>barriers</strong> are <strong>organizations</strong> facing in <strong>implementing</strong> <strong>GDPR</strong> protocols? <strong>Quite</strong> a few, but <strong>I’ll</strong> <strong>focus</strong> on the top three cultural <strong>barriers</strong> here because it takes longer to shift organizational <strong>cultures</strong> than it takes to develop new technologies. These are: 

 
	 
 A user design culture. <strong>Years</strong> of <strong>design</strong> thinking have produced wonderfully intuitive <strong>user</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>), but tap-and-swipe, drag-and-drop <strong>actions</strong>, second <strong>nature</strong> for us all, <strong>amount</strong> to <strong>moving</strong> <strong>data sets</strong> in and out of corporate <strong>perimeters</strong> and often out of national boundaries. Data flows are invisible, and the GDPR wants to make them visible again. Unlearning our <strong>UI</strong> <strong>instincts</strong>, and pausing to think “Is this cut-and-paste <strong>job</strong> going to make <strong>living</strong> people identifiable?” will be tough. A boardroom culture. <strong>Years</strong> of thought <strong>leadership</strong> on digital <strong>transformation</strong> have produced a corporate <strong>culture</strong> of over-collecting personal <strong>data</strong> without a <strong>corresponding discipline</strong> of measuring the <strong>return</strong> on investment. Personal <strong>data brings</strong> with it a <strong>cost</strong> and a <strong>risk</strong> the <strong>moment</strong> it enters an <strong>organization</strong>: It is a <strong>liability</strong> long before it becomes an asset. The <strong>GDPR</strong> has placed a <strong>precise</strong> and hefty <strong>price tag</strong> on the <strong>cost</strong> and risk of <strong>handling</strong> personal <strong>data</strong> so that, in <strong>addition</strong> to ending <strong>indiscriminate collection</strong> and <strong>lax security</strong> <strong>practices</strong>, hopefully, it will encourage more disciplined <strong>treatment</strong> of the <strong>enterprise value</strong> of personal <strong>data</strong>. Vendor/contractor culture. <strong>Nineteen</strong> <strong>months</strong> to <strong>enforcement date</strong>, I am not aware of any large IT household <strong>name</strong> that has a GDPR-compliant or GDPR-proof <strong>product</strong> or <strong>service</strong> on the market. My <strong>guess</strong> is that, right until the <strong>end</strong>, <strong><strong>GDPR</strong></strong>-defying <strong>products</strong> will continue to be bought until the <strong><strong>GDPR</strong></strong> <strong>emergency</strong> is so obvious to all that it becomes a <strong>compelling reason</strong> to upgrade or buy new <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong> with <strong><strong>GDPR</strong></strong> options. What makes <strong>matters</strong> worse is that the <strong>businesses</strong> with enough <strong>foresight</strong> to start the <strong>GDPR</strong> <strong>compliance journey</strong> early <strong>end</strong> up paying for the <strong>research</strong> and <strong>development</strong> <strong>costs</strong> of the new <strong>GDPR</strong>-compliant <strong>offerings</strong> by these same v<strong>end</strong>ors. 5. You're speaking at the O’Reilly <strong>Security Conference</strong> in <strong>Amsterdam</strong> this November . What presentations are you looking forward to attending while there? All of them! I am a <strong>bona fide conference junkie</strong> and find it exhilarating to attend large <strong>events</strong> where <strong>brains</strong> come together and <strong>faces</strong> light up all the <strong>time</strong> in those very precious <strong>“ah-ha”</strong> moments. I make it a <strong>point</strong> of attending the <strong>ones</strong> I do not even grasp the <strong>title</strong> of—if I already understand 80<strong>%</strong> of the <strong>words</strong> and <strong>concepts</strong> in the <strong>presentation</strong>, I'm not learning and <strong>am</strong> sitting in the wrong room! <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> How the EU’s <strong>GDPR</strong> affects all of us.</body>
