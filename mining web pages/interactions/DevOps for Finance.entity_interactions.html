 <strong>Download</strong> a free <strong>copy</strong> of <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> for <strong>Finance</strong> , an O’Reilly <strong>report</strong> by <strong>Jim Bird</strong> for the financial <strong>services</strong> <strong>software insider</strong> who's heard about <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong>, but is <strong>unsure</strong> whether it represents solution or suicide. <strong>DevOps</strong>, until recently, has been a <strong>story</strong> about unicorns. Innovative, engineering-driven <strong>online tech</strong> <strong>companies</strong> like <strong>Flickr</strong>, <strong>Etsy</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, and Google. Netflix and its Chaos Monkey. <strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>deploying</strong> <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong>changes</strong> per day. <strong>DevOps</strong> was originally about <strong>WebOps</strong> at <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>companies</strong> working in the <strong>Cloud</strong>, and a <strong>handful</strong> of <strong>Lean Startups</strong> in Silicon Valley. It started at these <strong>companies</strong> because they had to move quickly, so they found new, simple, and collaborative <strong>ways</strong> of working that allowed them to innovate much <strong>faster</strong> and to scale much more effectively than organizations had done before. But as the <strong>velocity</strong> of <strong>change</strong> in <strong>business</strong> continues to increase, <strong>enterprises</strong> — sometimes referred to as "<strong>horses</strong>," in <strong>contrast</strong> to the <strong>unicorns</strong> referenced above — must also move to deliver <strong>content</strong> and <strong>features</strong> to customers just as quickly. These large <strong>organizations</strong> have started to adopt (and, along the <strong>way</strong>, <strong>adapt</strong>) <strong>DevOps</strong> <strong>ideas</strong>, <strong>practices</strong>, and tools. This short <strong>book</strong> assumes that you have heard about <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> and want to understand how <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> <strong>practices</strong> like <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure</strong> as <strong>Code</strong> can be used to solve <strong>problems</strong> in financial <strong>systems</strong> at a <strong>trading firm</strong>, or a big <strong>bank</strong> or stock exchange. We'll look at the following key <strong><strong>ideas</strong></strong> in <strong>DevOps</strong>, and how they fit into the <strong>world</strong> of financial <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong>: 
 
 Breaking down the "<strong>wall</strong> of <strong>confusion</strong>" between <strong><strong>development</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>operations</strong></strong>, and extending <strong>Agile</strong> <strong>practices</strong> and <strong>values</strong> from <strong><strong>development</strong></strong> to <strong><strong>operations</strong></strong> 
 Using automated <strong>configuration management</strong> <strong>tools</strong> like <strong>Chef</strong>, <strong>Puppet</strong>, <strong>CFEngine</strong>, or <strong>Ansible</strong> to programmatically <strong>provision</strong> and <strong>configure</strong> <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> (<strong><strong>Infrastructure</strong></strong> as <strong>Code</strong>) 
 Building Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) <strong>pipelines</strong> to automatically <strong>test</strong> and push out <strong>changes</strong>, and wiring <strong>security</strong> and <strong>compliance</strong> into these <strong>pipelines</strong> 
 Using <strong>containerization</strong> and <strong>virtualization</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> like <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Vagrant</strong>, together with <strong><strong>Infrastructure</strong></strong> as <strong>Code</strong>, to create <strong>IaaS</strong>, <strong>PaaS</strong>, and <strong>SaaS</strong> <strong>clouds</strong> 
 <strong>Running</strong> <strong>experiments</strong>, creating fast feedback <strong>loops</strong>, and <strong>learning</strong> from <strong>failure</strong> 
 
 To follow this <strong>book</strong> you need to understand a little about these <strong><strong>ideas</strong></strong> and <strong>practices</strong>. There is a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>good stuff</strong> about <strong>DevOps</strong> out there, amid the hype. A good <strong>place</strong> to start is by <strong>watching</strong> <strong>John Allspaw</strong> and <strong>Paul Hammond</strong>'s <strong>presentation</strong> at <strong>Velocity</strong> 2009, "10+ <strong>Deploys</strong> <strong>Per Day</strong>: <strong>Dev</strong> and <strong>Ops Cooperation</strong> at <strong>Flickr</strong>" , which introduced <strong>Dev</strong>Ops <strong>ideas</strong> to the public. IT <strong>Revolution</strong>'s free "<strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> <strong>Guide</strong>" will also help you to get started with <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong>, and <strong>point</strong> you to other good resources. The <strong>Phoenix Project</strong>: A <strong>Novel About IT</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>Helping Your Business Win</strong> by <strong>Gene Kim</strong>, <strong>Kevin Behr</strong>, and <strong>George Spafford (</strong>also from IT <strong>Revolution</strong>) is another great introduction, and surprisingly fun to read. If you want to understand the technical <strong>practices</strong> behind <strong>DevOps</strong>, you should also take the <strong>time</strong> to read Continuous Delivery (Addison- Wesley), by <strong>Dave Farley</strong> and Jez Humble. Finally, <strong><strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong></strong> in <strong>Practice</strong> is a free <strong>ebook</strong> from O'Reilly that <strong>explains</strong> how <strong><strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong></strong> can be applied in large <strong>organizations</strong>, walking through <strong><strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong></strong> <strong>initiatives</strong> at <strong>Nordstrom</strong> and Texas.gov. Common <strong>challenges</strong> 
 From small <strong>trading</strong> <strong>firms</strong> to big <strong>banks</strong> and <strong>exchanges</strong>, financial <strong>industry</strong> <strong>players</strong> are looking at the <strong>success</strong> of <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong> for <strong>ideas</strong> on how to improve <strong>speed</strong> of <strong>delivery</strong> in IT, how to innovate faster, how to reduce <strong>operations costs</strong>, and how to solve <strong>online</strong> scaling problems. Financial <strong>services</strong>, cloud <strong>services</strong> providers, and other <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>tech</strong> <strong>companies</strong> <strong>share</strong> many common <strong>tech</strong>nology and <strong>business</strong> challenges. They all deal with problems of scale. They run <strong>farms</strong> of <strong><strong><strong>thousands</strong></strong></strong> or <strong>tens</strong> of <strong><strong><strong>thousands</strong></strong></strong> of <strong>servers</strong>, and <strong><strong><strong>thousands</strong></strong></strong> of applications. No <strong><strong>bank</strong></strong> — even the biggest too-big-to-fail <strong><strong>bank</strong></strong> — can compete with the <strong>number</strong> of <strong>users</strong> that an <strong>online company</strong> like <strong>Facebook</strong> or <strong>Twitter</strong> supports. On the other <strong>hand</strong>, the <strong>volume</strong> and <strong>value</strong> of <strong>transactions</strong> that a major <strong>stock exchange</strong> or clearinghouse <strong>hand</strong>les in a <strong>trading day</strong> dwarfs that of <strong>online</strong> <strong>sites</strong> like <strong>Amazon</strong> or Etsy. While <strong>Netflix</strong> <strong>deals</strong> with massive <strong>amounts</strong> of streaming <strong>video traffic</strong>, financial <strong>trading</strong> <strong>firms</strong> must be able to keep up with low-latency <strong>online market</strong> <strong>data</strong> that can peak at several <strong>millions</strong> of <strong>messages</strong> per second, where nanosecond accuracy is necessary. These <strong>Big Data</strong> <strong>worlds</strong> are coming closer together, as more financial <strong>firms</strong> like <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>, and <strong>Bank</strong> of <strong>America</strong> <strong>adopt</strong> <strong>data analytics platforms</strong> like Hadoop. <strong>Google</strong> (in <strong>partnership</strong> with SunGard) is one of the shortlisted <strong>providers</strong> bidding on the <strong>Securities</strong> and <strong>Exchange Commission</strong>'s new Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), a <strong>secure platform</strong> that will hold the complete <strong>record</strong> of every <strong>order</strong>, <strong>quote</strong>, and <strong>trade</strong> in the <strong>US</strong> equities and <strong>equities options markets</strong>: more than 50 billion <strong>record</strong>s per <strong>day</strong> from 2,000 <strong>trading</strong> <strong>firms</strong> and <strong>exchanges</strong>, all of which needs to be kept <strong>online</strong> for several years. This will add up to several petabytes of data. The financial <strong>services</strong> <strong>industry</strong>, like the <strong>online tech world</strong>, is viciously competitive, and there is a <strong>premium</strong> on <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong>time</strong> to market. <strong>Businesses</strong> (and IT) are under constantly increasing <strong>pressure</strong> to deliver faster, and with greater <strong>efficiency</strong> — but not at the <strong>expense</strong> of <strong>reliability</strong> of <strong>service</strong> or security. Financial <strong><strong>services</strong></strong> can look to <strong>DevOps</strong> for <strong>ways</strong> to introduce new <strong>products</strong> and <strong><strong>services</strong></strong> faster, but at the same <strong>time</strong> they need to work within <strong>constraints</strong> to meet strict up<strong>time</strong> and <strong>performance service-level</strong> <strong>agreements</strong> (<strong>SLAs</strong>) and <strong>compliance</strong> and <strong>governance</strong> requirements. <strong><strong>DevOps</strong> tools</strong> in the <strong>finance industry</strong> 
 <strong>DevOps</strong> is about changing <strong>culture</strong> and improving <strong>collaboration</strong> between <strong>development</strong> and operations. But it is also about automating as many of the common <strong>jobs</strong> in delivering <strong>software</strong> and maintaining <strong>operating</strong> <strong>systems</strong> as possible: <strong>testing</strong>, <strong>compliance</strong> and <strong>security</strong> <strong>checks</strong>, <strong>software</strong> packaging and <strong>configuration management</strong>, and deployment. This strong <strong>basis</strong> in <strong>automation</strong> and tooling <strong>explains</strong> why so many <strong>vendors</strong> are so excited about DevOps. A common <strong>DevOps</strong> <strong>toolchain</strong> includes: 
 
 <strong>Version</strong> <strong>control</strong> and <strong>artifact</strong> <strong>repositories</strong> 
 <strong>Continuous Integration</strong>/Continuous <strong>Delivery</strong> <strong><strong>servers</strong></strong> like <strong><strong>Jenkins</strong></strong>, <strong>Bamboo</strong>, <strong>TeamCity</strong>, and Go 
 <strong>Automated</strong> <strong><strong>test</strong>ing</strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong>tools</strong></strong></strong></strong> (including static <strong>analysis</strong> <strong>checkers</strong> and 
automated <strong>test</strong> <strong>frameworks</strong>) 
 <strong>Automated</strong> release/deployment <strong><strong><strong><strong>tools</strong></strong></strong></strong> 
 <strong>Infrastructure</strong> as <strong>Code</strong>: software-defined <strong>configuration <strong>management</strong></strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong>tools</strong></strong></strong></strong> like <strong>Ansible</strong>, <strong>Chef</strong>, <strong>CFEngine</strong>, and Puppet 
 Virtualization and <strong>containerization</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> such as <strong>Docker</strong> 
and Vagrant 
 
 Build <strong>management</strong> <strong><strong><strong><strong>tools</strong></strong></strong></strong> like <strong>Maven</strong> and <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> <strong><strong>servers</strong></strong> like <strong><strong>Jenkins</strong></strong> are already well established across the <strong>industry</strong> through <strong>Agile</strong> <strong>development</strong> programs. Using static <strong>analysis</strong> <strong>tools</strong> to <strong>test</strong> for <strong>security</strong> <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> and common <strong>coding</strong> <strong>bugs</strong> and implementing automated system <strong>test</strong>ing are common <strong>practices</strong> in developing financial systems. But as we'll see, popular <strong>test</strong> <strong>frameworks</strong> like <strong>JUnit</strong> and <strong>Selenium</strong> aren't a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>help</strong> in <strong>solving</strong> some of the hard <strong>test</strong> automation <strong>problems</strong> for financial <strong>systems</strong>: integration <strong>test</strong>ing, security <strong>test</strong>ing, and performance <strong>test</strong>ing. <strong>Log</strong> <strong>management</strong> and <strong>analysis</strong> <strong>tools</strong> such as <strong>Splunk</strong> are being used effectively at financial <strong>services organizations</strong> like <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>, <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>, <strong>ING</strong>, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for operational and <strong>security event</strong> monitoring, fraud <strong>analysis</strong> and <strong>surveillance</strong>, <strong>transaction</strong> monitoring, and compliance reporting. <strong>Automated</strong> <strong>configuration management</strong> and provisioning <strong>systems</strong> and automated <strong>release management</strong> tools are becoming more widely adopted. <strong>CFEngine</strong>, the earliest of these <strong>tools</strong>, is used by 5 of the 10 largest <strong>banks</strong> on <strong>Wall Street</strong>, including JP Morgan Chase. <strong>Puppet</strong> is being used extensively at the <strong>International Securities Exchange</strong>, <strong>NYSE</strong>, E*Trade, and the <strong>Bank</strong> of America. <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, the <strong>Standard Bank</strong> of <strong>South Africa (</strong>the largest <strong>bank</strong> in Africa), and <strong>others</strong> are using Chef. <strong>Electric Cloud</strong>'s automated <strong>build</strong> and <strong>deployment</strong> <strong>solutions</strong> are being used by global <strong>investment</strong> <strong>banks</strong> and other financial services firms like E*Trade. While most front <strong><strong>office</strong> trading</strong> <strong>systems</strong> still run on <strong>bare metal</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to meet low <strong>latency</strong> <strong>requirements</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong> and other <strong>containerization</strong> and <strong>virtualization</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> are being used to create private <strong>clouds</strong> for <strong>testing</strong>, <strong>data analytics</strong>, and back <strong>office</strong> <strong>functions</strong> in large financial <strong>institutions</strong> like <strong>ING</strong>, <strong>Société Générale</strong>, and Goldman Sachs. Financial <strong>players</strong> are truly becoming <strong>part</strong> of the broader <strong>DevOps</strong> <strong>community</strong> by also giving back and <strong>part</strong>icipating in open <strong>source</strong> projects. For <strong>example</strong>, <strong>LMAX</strong>, who we will look at in more <strong>detail</strong> later, has open sourced its automated tooling and even some of its <strong>core infrastructure technology</strong> (such as the <strong>low-latency</strong> <strong>Disruptor inter-thread</strong> messaging library). And at this <strong>year</strong>'s <strong>OSCON</strong>, <strong>Capital</strong> One released <strong>Hygieia</strong> , an open <strong>source</strong> <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> dashboard. Financial <strong>operations</strong> is not WebOps 
 Financial <strong>services firms</strong> are hiring <strong>DevOps engineers</strong> to automate <strong>releases</strong> and to build Continuous <strong>Delivery</strong> <strong>pipelines</strong>, and <strong>Site Reliability</strong> <strong>Engineers</strong> <strong>(</strong>patterned after Google) to work in their <strong>operations</strong> teams. But the <strong>jobs</strong> in these <strong>firms</strong> are different in many <strong><strong>way</strong>s</strong>, because a global <strong>bank</strong> or a <strong>stock exchange</strong> doesn't operate the same <strong>way</strong> as <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> or one of the large <strong>online</strong> shopping sites. Here are some of the <strong>differences</strong>: 
 
 <strong>Banks</strong> or <strong>investment</strong> <strong>advisers</strong> can't run continuous, <strong>online</strong> behavioral <strong>experiments</strong> on their <strong>users</strong>, like Facebook has done. Something like this could violate securities laws. <strong>DevOps practices</strong> like "<strong>Monitoring</strong> as <strong>Testing</strong>" and giving <strong>developers</strong> <strong>root access</strong> to <strong>production</strong> in "<strong>NoOps</strong>" <strong><strong>environments</strong></strong> so that they can run the <strong>systems</strong> themselves work for <strong>online</strong> social <strong>media startups</strong>, but won't fly in highly regulated <strong><strong>environments</strong></strong> with strict <strong>requirements</strong> for <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>assurance</strong>, formal <strong>release approval</strong>, and <strong>segregation</strong> of duties. <strong>Web</strong> and mobile have become important <strong>channels</strong> in financial <strong><strong>services</strong></strong> — for <strong>example</strong>, in <strong>online banking</strong> and retail <strong>trading</strong> — and <strong>web</strong> <strong><strong>services</strong></strong> are used for some <strong>B2B system-to-system</strong> transactions. But most of what <strong>happens</strong> in financial <strong>systems</strong> is system-to-system through industry-standard electronic <strong>messaging</strong> <strong>protocols</strong> like <strong>FIX</strong>, <strong>FAST</strong>, and <strong>SWIFT</strong>, and <strong>low-latency proprietary</strong> <strong>APIs</strong> with <strong>names</strong> like <strong>ITCH</strong> and OUCH. This means that <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>ideas</strong> designed for <strong>solving web</strong> and mobile <strong>development</strong> and operations problems can't always be relied on. Continuous <strong>Deployment</strong>, where <strong>developers</strong> push <strong><strong>change</strong>s</strong> out to <strong>production</strong> immediately and automatically, <strong>works</strong> well in <strong>stateless web</strong> <strong>applications</strong>, but it creates all <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong>challenges</strong> and <strong>problems</strong> for interconnected <strong>B2B</strong> <strong>systems</strong> that <strong>ex<strong>change</strong></strong> <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong>messages</strong> per second at low <strong>latencies</strong>, and where <strong>regulators</strong> expect <strong>change</strong> <strong>schedules</strong> to be published up to two <strong>quarters</strong> in advance. This is why this <strong>book</strong> focuses on <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>: building up automated <strong>pipelines</strong> so that every <strong>change</strong> is tested and ready to be deployed, but leaving actual <strong>deployment</strong> of <strong>change</strong>s to <strong>production</strong> to be coordinated and controlled by <strong>operations</strong> and <strong>compliance</strong> <strong>teams</strong>, not developers. While almost all <strong>Internet</strong> <strong><strong>businesses</strong></strong> run 24/7, most financial <strong><strong>businesses</strong></strong>, especially financial <strong>markets</strong>, run on a short trading day cycle. This means that a massive <strong><strong>amount</strong></strong> of <strong>activity</strong> is compressed into a small <strong><strong>amount</strong></strong> of time. It also means that there is a built-in <strong>window</strong> for <strong>after-hours</strong> maintenance and upgrading. While <strong>online</strong> <strong>companies</strong> like <strong>Etsy</strong> must meet <strong>PCI DSS</strong> <strong>regulations</strong> for <strong>credit card</strong> <strong>data</strong> and SOX-404 auditing <strong>requirements</strong>, this only affects the "<strong>cash register</strong>" <strong>part</strong> of the business. A financial <strong>services</strong> <strong>organization</strong> is effectively one big <strong>cash register</strong>, where almost everything <strong>needs</strong> to be audited and almost every <strong>activity</strong> is under regulatory oversight. Financial <strong>industry</strong> <strong>players</strong> were some of the earliest and biggest <strong>adopters</strong> of information technology. This long <strong>history</strong> of <strong>investing</strong> in <strong>technology</strong> also leaves them heavily weighed down by <strong>legacy</strong> <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> built up over <strong>decades</strong>; <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> that were not designed for rapid, iterative change. The <strong>legacy problem</strong> is made even worse by the <strong>duplication</strong> and <strong>overlap</strong> of <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> inherited through <strong>mergers</strong> and <strong>acquisitions</strong>: a global <strong>investment bank</strong> can have <strong><strong>dozens</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> performing similar <strong>functions</strong> and <strong><strong>dozens</strong></strong> of <strong>copies</strong> of <strong>master file</strong> <strong>data</strong> that need to be kept in sync. These <strong><strong>system</strong>s</strong> have become more and more interconnected across the <strong>industry</strong>, which makes <strong>changes</strong> much more difficult and riskier, as <strong>problems</strong> can cascade from one <strong>system</strong> — and one organization — to another. In <strong>addition</strong> to the <strong>forces</strong> of <strong>inertia</strong>, there are significant <strong>challenges</strong> and <strong>costs</strong> to adopting <strong>DevOps</strong> in the financial industry. But the <strong>benefits</strong> are too great to ignore, as are the <strong>risks</strong> of not delivering <strong>value</strong> to <strong>customers</strong> quickly enough and losing them to <strong>competitors</strong> — especially to disruptive <strong>online</strong> <strong>startups</strong> powered by DevOps. We'll start by looking at the <strong>challenges</strong> in more <strong>detail</strong>, to understand better how financial <strong>organizations</strong> need to change in <strong>order</strong> for them to succeed with <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong>, and how <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> needs to be changed to meet their requirements. Then we'll look at how <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> <strong>practices</strong> can be — and have been — successfully adopted to develop and operate financial <strong>systems</strong>, borrowing <strong>ideas</strong> from <strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong> <strong>leaders</strong> like <strong>Etsy</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, and others. <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The <strong>views</strong> expressed in this <strong>book</strong> are those of the <strong>author</strong>, and do not reflect those of his <strong>employer</strong> or publisher.</body>
