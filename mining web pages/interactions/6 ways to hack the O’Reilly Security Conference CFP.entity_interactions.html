    <body><strong>Tips</strong> for writing a successful <strong>proposal</strong> for the O'Reilly Security Conference. Recently, we provided an <strong>inside look</strong> at the <strong>call</strong> for <strong>proposals</strong> (<strong>CFP</strong>) <strong>process</strong> for the O’Reilly Security Conference . In that <strong>post</strong>, we focused on how we managed <strong>CFP</strong> <strong>review</strong>, the <strong>metrics</strong> from our 2016 <strong>events</strong>, and our overall <strong>approach</strong> to <strong>shaping</strong> the conference. Now, we’re <strong>sharing</strong> common <strong>traits</strong> of the highest-reviewed <strong>proposals</strong> to help you successfully navigate the <strong>CFP</strong> <strong>process</strong> next year. We’ve both been on the <strong>program committee</strong> for several <strong>conferences</strong>, and were thrilled to have such a strong <strong>set</strong> of <strong>proposals</strong> to work with this year. If you didn’t make it in for O’Reilly <strong>Security NY</strong> or O’Reilly <strong>Security Amsterdam</strong> , here are some common <strong>themes</strong> we saw differentiating the top-tier talks: 

 1. <strong>Propose</strong> a practical, defense-focused <strong>talk</strong> 

 We’ve <strong>built</strong> our new O’Reilly <strong>Security</strong> <strong>Conferences</strong> to unite <strong>in-the-trenches</strong> defensive <strong>security</strong> <strong>practitioners</strong>, to open discourse on <strong>defending</strong> <strong>organizations</strong>, and to provide a <strong>forum</strong> for <strong>sharing</strong> concrete solutions. Want to talk about breaking? Great! Then, <strong>flip</strong> the topic <strong>around</strong> and tell us how to fix it. We all know that there are problems. Let’s talk about solutions. 2. <strong>Offer</strong> a <strong><strong>novel</strong></strong> or creative <strong>idea</strong>, <strong>approach</strong>, or <strong>opinion</strong> 

 With so many <strong>talks</strong> to choose from, the <strong>ones</strong> that really stood out included <strong><strong>novel</strong></strong> (if practical<strong>)</strong> <strong>approach</strong>es. There were many <strong>topics</strong> (<strong>hello</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>) that were popular in the CFP. If we received <strong>multiple talks</strong> on the exact <strong>same subject</strong>, we had to make some difficult <strong>choices</strong> about which presentations should be chosen. Consistently, the <strong>program committee</strong> prioritized <strong>presentations</strong> with a fresh approach. Take heed. 3. <strong>Focus</strong> on what the <strong>audience</strong> will gain 

 There are a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>security</strong> <strong>conferences</strong> out there that deliver amazing research. We’re trying <strong>something</strong> a little different—a <strong>focus</strong> on pragmatic <strong>approaches</strong> for practitioners. So we tried to focus on <strong>building</strong> an <strong>agenda</strong> that <strong>delivers</strong> on the <strong>promise</strong> to provide <strong>attendees</strong> with practical, useful tips they can apply immediately. That means that <strong>talks</strong> that highlighted what the <strong>attendees</strong> would learn grabbed our <strong>attention</strong>, over <strong>talks</strong> that simply described a <strong>point</strong> of <strong>view</strong>, <strong>concept</strong>, or research finding. Also, <strong><strong>proposals</strong></strong> that made it easy for us to understand what the <strong>speaker</strong> was going to share with the <strong>audience</strong> picked up <strong>bonus</strong> <strong>points</strong> over <strong><strong>proposals</strong></strong> that only dropped hints. <strong>(</strong><strong>Save</strong> the <strong>surprises</strong> for <strong>Ally’s</strong> <strong>birthday extravaganza</strong>.) 4. Don’t <strong>pitch</strong> 

 While the <strong><strong>conference</strong> marketing team</strong> <strong>works</strong> closely with a <strong>number</strong> of <strong>conference</strong> <strong>sponsors</strong>, the <strong>program committee</strong> <strong>sticks</strong> to a purely editorial process. The <strong>O'Reilly-ans</strong> describe this as "<strong>separation</strong> of <strong>church</strong> and <strong>state</strong>" and we think strict <strong>adherence</strong> to this <strong>principle</strong> yields the best <strong>results</strong> for everyone involved. On the <strong>program committee <strong>side</strong></strong>, we err very much on the <strong>side</strong> of technical <strong>talks</strong> with <strong>lessons</strong> learned and practical takeaways. If you are proposing a <strong>talk</strong> about a <strong>product</strong> (notably your own<strong>)</strong>, teach <strong>attendees</strong> useful <strong>things</strong> and demonstrate their credibility. Attendees are then likely to look at your product. <strong>Pitch</strong> them and they'll instead be reluctant to look at the <strong>product</strong>, and learn less in the process. 5. Write well 

 We’re not copyediting your proposal. Ain’t nobody got time for that. But we do care whether you’ve thought carefully about what you’d like to present, and whether you’ve clearly articulated that focus. Also, you will ultimately be presenting this <strong>talk</strong> in <strong>front</strong> of a <strong>crowd</strong>, with slides, which we do suggest you also carefully edit. When you’re tasked with <strong>reviewing</strong> 400+ <strong>proposals</strong>, the <strong>sloppy</strong> ones are usually the first to go. 6. Be brief and avoid <strong><strong><strong>jargon</strong></strong></strong> 

 While common <strong><strong><strong>jargon</strong></strong></strong> within <strong>proposals</strong> did spur some colorful <strong>outbursts</strong> (and at least one drinking <strong>game</strong> among <strong>program committee</strong> <strong>members</strong>), we’re <strong>less</strong> interested in <strong><strong><strong>jargon</strong></strong></strong> and much more interested in <strong>solving long-standing</strong> problems. And we can all agree, there are plenty of those to keep us busy. It was the focused, buzzword-free proposals that consistently received strong ratings. The <strong>CFP</strong> for the 2017 O’Reilly <strong>Security Conference</strong> will open sometime next spring. <strong>Sign</strong> up for <strong>O’Reilly’s</strong> weekly <strong>security newsletter</strong> or follow @<strong>oreillysecurity</strong> on <strong>Twitter</strong> to be alerted when the <strong>CFP</strong> window opens. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> 6 <strong>ways</strong> to hack the O’Reilly Security Conference CFP.</body>
