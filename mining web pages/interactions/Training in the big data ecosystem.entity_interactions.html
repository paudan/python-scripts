    <body><strong>Subscribe</strong> to the O'Reilly <strong>Radar Podcast</strong> to track the <strong>technologies</strong> and <strong>people</strong> that will shape our <strong>world</strong> in the years to come. In this <strong>week</strong>'s <strong>Radar Podcast</strong>, O'Reilly's <strong>Ben Lorica</strong> talks to <strong>Paco Nathan</strong> , <strong>director</strong> of O'Reilly <strong>Learning</strong>, and <strong>Jesse Anderson</strong> , technical <strong>trainer</strong> and creative <strong>engineer</strong> at Confluent. Their <strong>discussion</strong> <strong>focuses</strong> on the <strong>training landscape</strong> in the big <strong>data</strong> <strong>ecosystem</strong>, their <strong>teaching</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> and particular <strong>content</strong> they choose, and a <strong>look</strong> at some expected future trends. Here are a few <strong>snippets</strong> from their <strong>chat</strong>: 
 Training <strong>vs</strong> <strong>PowerPoint</strong> slides 
 <strong>Anderson</strong>: "Often, when you have a <strong>startup</strong> and <strong>somebody</strong> says, <strong>'Well</strong>, we need some <strong><strong>training</strong></strong>,' what will usually happen is one of the <strong>software</strong> <strong>developers</strong> will say, 'OK, I've done some <strong><strong>training</strong></strong> in the past and I'll put together some <strong>PowerPoint</strong>s.' The <strong>differences</strong> between a <strong><strong>training</strong> thing</strong> and doing some <strong>PowerPoints</strong>, like at a <strong>meetup</strong>, is that a <strong>training</strong> actually has to have hands-on exercises. It has to have artifacts that you use right there in class. You actually need to think through, these are <strong>concepts</strong>, these are <strong>things</strong> that the <strong>person</strong> will need to be successful in that project. It really takes a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>time</strong> and it takes some serious <strong>expertise</strong> and some experience in how to do that." <strong>Nathan</strong>: "Early on, you would get some <strong>committer</strong> to go out and do a <strong>meetup</strong>, maybe talk about an <strong>extension</strong> to an API or whatever they were working on directly. If there was a <strong>client firm</strong> that came up and needed <strong>training</strong>, then they'd peel off somebody. As it evolved, that really didn't work. That kind of model doesn't scale. The other <strong>thing</strong> too is, you really do need <strong>people</strong> who <strong>understand</strong> instructional <strong>design</strong>, who really <strong>understand</strong> how to manage a classroom. Especially when it gets to any <strong>size</strong>, it's not just a <strong>afterthought</strong> for an engineer to handle." Framing the <strong>training</strong> 
 <strong>Anderson</strong>: "[<strong>Companies</strong> are] starting to look for, 'OK, we've done <strong><strong>Hadoop</strong></strong> or we have <strong><strong>Hadoop</strong></strong> already in <strong>place</strong>, we want to start doing <strong>things</strong> in more real time.' So, they're starting to look at the real-time <strong>frameworks</strong> like <strong>Spark</strong> <strong>streaming</strong> and, in some <strong>cases</strong> <strong>Flink</strong> , but what we're generally going to see is that a <strong>lot</strong> of these new <strong>technologies</strong> that are coming out that enable more real-time <strong>processing</strong> of big data, this is what they're going after. One of those big technologies is Kafka. <strong>Part</strong> of the <strong>reason</strong> why I partnered with <strong>Confluent</strong> to do the <strong><strong>Kafka</strong></strong> <strong>training</strong>, I'd go into <strong>companies</strong> and they'd say 'Okay, here's our general <strong>architecture diagram</strong> and it all starts out with <strong><strong>Kafka</strong></strong> and goes into either <strong>Hadoop</strong> or Spark or both.'" <strong>Nathan</strong>: "<strong>People</strong> want to focus on the context. Really, what's the <strong>business context</strong> and what <strong>kind</strong> of architectural <strong>patterns</strong> <strong>work</strong> for the right <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>use</strong> cases? As <strong>Jesse</strong> was mentioning, I think that maybe the <strong>people</strong> who make a given <strong>framework</strong> aren't necessarily going to be the <strong>ones</strong> who are as invested in <strong>showing</strong> all the different integrations possible. That's the borderlands. I do find that <strong>people</strong> come to <strong>training</strong> to find out more about what <strong>integrations</strong> are possible, what <strong>ones</strong> make sense. Like we were mentioning about <strong>Spark</strong> and <strong>Kafka</strong>, maybe put <strong>Cassandra</strong> in that mix. That's a <strong>pattern</strong> that shows up in <strong>banking</strong>, it shows up in genomics. It shows up all over. It's a good <strong>illustration</strong> of the <strong>integrations</strong> that people are really craving." Educating the <strong>enterprise</strong> 
 <strong>Anderson</strong>: "One of the big <strong>gaps</strong> is that we've done great <strong>things</strong> for <strong>engineers</strong> and for <strong>analysts</strong> and for some of the <strong>operations people</strong>, but we really haven't dealt with the <strong>business</strong> people. I saw this when I was teaching at <strong>Cloudera</strong>; I'd have <strong>managers</strong> or even sometimes director-level <strong>people</strong> that publicly traded <strong>companies</strong> sitting through my entire four-day class. I thought, they either have a great <strong>love</strong> of <strong>knowledge</strong> or they're really wasting their <strong>time</strong> — they could have gotten about what they needed in a day or so. ... A <strong>business person</strong> needs to have a general <strong><strong>idea</strong></strong> how these <strong>technologies</strong> work, but more importantly, they need to have an <strong><strong>idea</strong></strong> of how you make money at it. I created a <strong>course</strong> I call the <strong>Business</strong> of Big Data to address that. We go through the <strong>technology</strong> at a high <strong>level</strong>, but it's the <strong>applications</strong> of the <strong>technology</strong> that we focus on. It's how do you use <strong><strong>technology</strong></strong>, big <strong>data</strong> <strong><strong>technology</strong></strong>, in <strong>order</strong> to improve things. ... How do I use <strong>data</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to make a decision? What I call a data augmented decision. I'm going to use <strong>data</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to augment whatever decision I'm making but how do you work back from there? How do you create a successful big data project? One of the <strong>things</strong> I've seen is that <strong>companies</strong> will have <strong>difficulty</strong> carrying out that big <strong>data</strong> <strong>project</strong> because it's quite a <strong>bit different</strong> than other ones. It involves more technology. It involves more expertise and I found that some of them would have a difficult time in actually carrying that out." <strong>Nathan</strong>: "I've definitely been involved in in-house <strong><strong>training</strong></strong> for <strong>companies</strong> where it's hard to tell where the <strong><strong>training</strong></strong> <strong>stops</strong> and where the consulting starts. That's fair game. I think there's a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>room</strong> for that because <strong>people</strong> really want to understand the <strong>context</strong> before they could ever jump into a contract. One of the <strong>things</strong> there is if a <strong>team</strong> internally comes to a <strong>training session</strong>, then they can start to explore some of those <strong>issues</strong> that they might want to follow up with a contractor for. Another <strong>thing</strong> to embellish on some<strong>thing</strong> that <strong>Jesse</strong> was mentioning earlier, another really good <strong>reason</strong> why <strong>people</strong> come to these <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong>training</strong> outside the customized <strong>environment</strong>, though, is to hear what other <strong>people</strong> ask. There's a lot of value in that. I'm not sure if I should use the term, but the 'unknown unknowns.' If you can hear the <strong>pain</strong> <strong>points</strong> that other <strong>companies</strong> and other <strong>teams</strong> are experiencing and hear how the <strong>experts</strong> answer them, you might actually save your <strong>company</strong> a <strong>lot</strong> of time." <strong>Subscribe</strong> to the O'Reilly Radar Podcast
