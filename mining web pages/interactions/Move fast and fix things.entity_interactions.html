    <body><strong>Join Dan Kaminsky</strong> at the O’Reilly <strong>Security Hackathon</strong> to help make web security easier and more effective. A <strong>lot</strong> of <strong><strong>security</strong></strong> is just making <strong>computers</strong> behave like we think they do: effective <strong><strong>security</strong></strong> <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>complexity</strong> of systems. Well-defined interfaces, known good state. This has been my mantra for a while—know what’s communicated, know what’s stored. We think we do this already; we have all <strong>sorts</strong> of very nice <strong>flow</strong> <strong>diagrams</strong>, a <strong>request</strong> goes in, a <strong>response</strong> goes out, and <strong>anything</strong> stored goes into the database. It’s simple, easy, and generally incorrect. But security can, and absolutely will, become more effective. How we got here 

 We have <strong>systems</strong> leaking <strong>memory</strong> over <strong>time</strong>, and <strong>network</strong> <strong>services</strong> willing to communicate a bit too much. Quietly, there’s been a significant <strong>increase</strong> in the <strong>difficulty</strong> of converting <strong>memory</strong> corruption—where a system’s <strong>behavior</strong> becomes “undefined”—into controlled, well redefined <strong>attacker</strong> controlled code. What used to take days really does take months now. We’ve made <strong>things</strong> much <strong>harder</strong> for <strong>attackers</strong> but not much <strong>harder</strong> for defenders. It’s not a zero sum game. Computers are different now than they were even just a few years back. We didn’t used to have a <strong>quarter terabyte</strong> of <strong>RAM</strong>, or <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong>parallel</strong> <strong>processors</strong>, or <strong>clouds</strong> willing to <strong>manage</strong> <strong>microservices</strong> by the instantiation. These <strong>sorts</strong> of <strong>shifts</strong> have completely changed how <strong>software</strong> is written and deployed (and maybe eliminated the difference between the two). We need to adapt our <strong>security</strong> <strong>strategies</strong> to keep <strong>pace</strong> with all this change. What we’re <strong>fixing</strong> 

 The driving <strong>demand</strong> of the first O’Reilly <strong>Security</strong> <strong>Hackathon</strong> really is: Make <strong>Security</strong> Easy. Possible is not enough. I think at this <strong>point</strong> every <strong>developer</strong> has tried some <strong>API</strong>, where there are a hundred possible <strong>ways</strong> to do something, and maybe one that actually works. Meanwhile, a delightful <strong>variety</strong> of <strong>misleading error</strong> <strong>messages</strong> serves to obscure the one working path. And that is how APIs die. Security is not remotely special in this regard. We’ve been exploring how to move fast and <strong>fix real security</strong> <strong>issues</strong> in the <strong>hackathon</strong>, and <strong>it’s</strong> been a <strong>lot</strong> of fun. We didn’t used to have a way to automatically certify a computer’s identity. With Let’s <strong>Encrypt (</strong><strong>aka</strong> CertBot), we do now. So we’ve been hacking on <strong>Jump</strong> to Full Encryption (JFE) and writing <strong>code</strong> that just certifiably encrypts everything—Apache, <strong>NGINX</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, Python; it just works. You don’t <strong>configure</strong> <strong>IP</strong> <strong>addresses</strong> and <strong>DHCP</strong> <strong>leases</strong> and <strong>DNS</strong> <strong>servers</strong> for each <strong>random component</strong> in your infrastructure. <strong>Security’s</strong> been a <strong><strong><strong><strong>lot</strong></strong></strong> harder</strong> than <strong>insecurity</strong>: a <strong><strong><strong>lot</strong></strong></strong> more expensive, a <strong><strong><strong>lot</strong></strong></strong> more difficult, a <strong><strong><strong>lot</strong></strong></strong> more error prone. But it’s the same job, for all of these services. You know what’s great at doing the same job over and over again? Computers. Calling all coders 

 There’s so much to work on. Maybe you can help us. Solutions don’t have to happen in full, instantly; compromises are still effective. I for one would like to see <strong>credit card</strong> <strong>breaches</strong> that only affect 500 customers. Along with <strong>JFE</strong>, there are <strong>properties</strong> of the <strong>cloud</strong> that we’re <strong>exploring</strong> under the <strong>Ratelock</strong> project . Constraining and precisely defining our potential <strong>losses</strong> is a <strong>theme</strong> of that <strong>work</strong>; we’re <strong>hoping</strong> to create an actual, effective, and performant isolation technique. We’re also trying to do <strong>something</strong> about the <strong>drudgery</strong> of <strong>handling</strong> the <strong>attacks</strong> that are starting to consume our networks. <strong>Remediation</strong> has to <strong>be</strong> accelerated or there won’t <strong>be</strong> a network to remediate. With <strong>Overflowd</strong>, for every one out of a million <strong>packets</strong> a <strong>tracer</strong> goes to the <strong>source</strong> and destination. It piggybacks on existing netflow <strong>monitoring infrastructure</strong>, provides <strong>abuse contact</strong> <strong>data</strong>, anti spoof, a <strong>bunch</strong> of <strong>neat</strong> properties. We need to aim traffic at it and see what happens. If it all sounds crazy, good. The <strong>software security status quo</strong> is not <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>nothing</strong> good should sound <strong>sane</strong> in the context of it. We’re here to write code and see what it can do. Move fast and fix things. Let’s make security easy. I hope to see you at the <strong>Hackathon</strong> in <strong>San Francisco (</strong><strong>happening</strong> now), and at the O’Reilly <strong>Security Conferences</strong> in <strong>New York</strong> and <strong>Amsterdam</strong> , or of <strong>course</strong>, on this Internet that we’d really like to keep from burning . <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> <strong>Move</strong> <strong>fast</strong> and fix things.</body>
