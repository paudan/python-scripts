    <body><strong>Download</strong> a free <strong>copy</strong> of our new <strong>report</strong> "<strong>User Experience Design</strong> for the <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong>," by <strong>Claire Rowland</strong>, to learn about a <strong>framework</strong> for <strong>understanding</strong> the <strong>UX</strong> of <strong>consumer</strong> <strong>IoT</strong> products. Note: this <strong>post</strong> is an <strong>excerpt</strong> from the report. When we think of <strong>design</strong> for connected <strong>products</strong>, we tend to focus on the most visible and tangible elements. These are the industrial <strong>design</strong> of connected <strong>devices</strong>, and the <strong>user</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> (<strong>UIs</strong>) found in mobile and <strong>Web</strong> <strong>apps</strong> and on the <strong>devices</strong> themselves. They are important <strong>concerns</strong>, which have a major <strong>impact</strong> on the <strong>end user</strong>'s <strong>experience</strong> of the product. But they're only part of the picture. You could create a beautiful <strong>UI</strong>, and a <strong>stunning piece</strong> of <strong>hardware</strong>, and <strong>users</strong> could still have a poor <strong>experience</strong> of the product as a whole. Designing for <strong>IoT</strong> is inherently more complex than <strong>Web</strong> service design. Some of this is to do with the current state of the technology. Some of this <strong>reflects</strong> our as-yet <strong>immature understanding</strong> of compelling <strong>consumer</strong> <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>value</strong> propositions. Some of this <strong>stems</strong> from the <strong>fact</strong> that there are more <strong>aspects</strong> of design to consider. Tackling them independently creates an incoherent user experience (UX). Designing a great connected <strong>product</strong> requires a holistic <strong>approach</strong> to user experience. It spans many layers of design, not all them immediately visible. More than ever, it requires cross-discipline <strong>collaboration</strong> between <strong>design</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, and business. <strong>Great UX</strong> may start with <strong>understanding</strong> users. But the <strong>designer</strong>'s <strong>ability</strong> to meet those <strong>users</strong>' <strong>needs depends</strong> on the <strong>technology</strong> <strong>enablers</strong>, <strong>business</strong> <strong>models</strong>, and wider service ecosystem. As <strong>designers</strong> and their <strong>collaborators</strong>, we need a shared <strong>understanding</strong> of the challenges. We also need a common vocabulary for <strong>discussing</strong> them so that when we use the <strong>word</strong> "<strong>design</strong>," we're talking about the same things. This <strong>report</strong> introduces a <strong>framework</strong> for <strong>understanding</strong> the <strong>experience design</strong> of <strong>consumer</strong> <strong>IoT</strong> products. It sets out the different <strong>facets</strong> of <strong>design</strong> that <strong>combine</strong> to <strong>shape</strong> a connected product, and shows you how they fit together. It explains the extra complexities that surround designing for connected products. And it discusses how <strong>technology</strong> and the <strong>wider commercial context work</strong> to <strong>shape</strong> the <strong>UX</strong> of <strong>IoT</strong> products. It's beyond the <strong>scope</strong> of this <strong>report</strong> to delve into the <strong>design process</strong> for IoT. This is more complex than <strong>pure software design</strong>: <strong>hardware</strong> adds new considerations and is less easily modified. <strong>Value</strong> <strong>propositions</strong> and <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> <strong>requirements</strong> must be clearly defined before <strong>product</strong> and <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> <strong>decisions</strong> are baked into the hardware, when they are hard to change. But here, we will show why the <strong>nature</strong> of the <strong>challenges</strong> requires <strong>collaboration</strong> between <strong>design</strong> and <strong>engineering</strong> for both <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong>, and the business. Why <strong>UX</strong> for <strong>IoT</strong> is different 
 <strong>Connected</strong> <strong>products</strong> pose <strong>design</strong> <strong>challenges</strong> that will be new to <strong>design</strong>ers accustomed to pure <strong>software</strong> services. Many of these <strong>stem</strong> from: 
 
 The specialized <strong>nature</strong> of <strong><strong>IoT</strong></strong> <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> 
 <strong>Their</strong> <strong>ability</strong> to bridge the digital and physical <strong>worlds</strong> 
 The <strong>fact</strong> that many <strong><strong>IoT</strong></strong> <strong>products</strong> are distributed sy<strong>stem</strong>s of <strong>multiple</strong> <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong>, and 
 The quirks of networking. How tricky those <strong>challenges</strong> prove will depend on: 
 
 The <strong>maturity</strong> of the <strong>technology</strong> you're working with 
 The <strong>context</strong> of <strong>use</strong>, and the <strong>expectations</strong> your <strong>use</strong>rs have of the <strong>system</strong>, and 
 The <strong>complexity</strong> of your <strong>service</strong> (for <strong>example</strong>, how many <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> the <strong>use</strong>r has to interact with) 
 
 But for most connected <strong>products</strong>, you'll need to consider the following <strong>factors</strong>: 
 Specialized <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong>, with different <strong>capabilities</strong> 
 Many of the <strong>'<strong>things</strong></strong>' in the <strong>internet</strong> of <strong>things</strong> are specialized embedded <strong>computing</strong> <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong>. Unlike general-purpose <strong>computers</strong> (<strong>smartphones</strong> and <strong>PCs</strong>), their <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong> is optimized to fulfill specific functions. Their physical forms must be designed and engineered. Their <strong>UI</strong> <strong>capabilities</strong> may extend from <strong>screens</strong> and <strong>buttons</strong> into physical <strong>controls</strong>, <strong>audio</strong>, <strong>haptics</strong>, <strong>gestures</strong> (see Fig. 1-1), tangible interactions and more. But <strong>user</strong> <strong>interactions</strong> must be designed without the <strong>benefit</strong> of the <strong>style</strong> guides and <strong>standards</strong> that <strong>Web</strong> and mobile designers can rely upon. Some may have no <strong>user input</strong> or <strong>output</strong> capabilities at all. The only <strong>way</strong> to find out what they are doing or what <strong>state</strong> they are in may be via a <strong>remote</strong> UI.

 <strong>Real</strong> <strong>world context</strong> 
 <strong>Connected</strong> <strong>products</strong> exist in the physical world. <strong>Sensors</strong> enable us to capture <strong>data</strong> we did not have before for digital <strong>transmission</strong>, allowing us to take more informed <strong>actions</strong> in the real world. <strong>Actuators</strong> provide the <strong>capability</strong> for digital <strong>commands</strong> to produce real <strong>world</strong> <strong>effects</strong> (see Fig. 1-2). They can be remotely controlled, or automated. But unlike digital commands, real-world actions often cannot be undone. [caption id="<strong>attachment_80240</strong>" <strong>align=</strong>"<strong>aligncenter</strong>" <strong>width=</strong>"570"] Fig. 1-2: <strong>Sensors</strong> convert <strong>readings</strong> from the physical <strong>environment</strong> into digital <strong>information</strong>; <strong>actuators</strong> convert digital <strong>instructions</strong> into mechanical actions. [/caption] 
 The physical <strong>context</strong> of <strong>use</strong> creates further challenges. Devices may need to be ruggedized for outdoor use. An in-car system needs to be designed to minimize distraction while driving. A remotely controlled oven needs to minimize the risk of fire. <strong>Devices</strong> must adhere to regulatory <strong>requirements</strong> such as <strong>radio interference</strong> or <strong>waste</strong> recycling standards. And the social <strong>context</strong> of <strong>use</strong> may be particularly complex, especially in the home. Techno-centric <strong>solutions</strong> that are insensitive to the <strong>needs</strong> of the occupants will fail. For <strong>example</strong>, an assisted <strong>living product</strong> <strong>need</strong>s to <strong>balance</strong> the <strong>need</strong> of vulnerable <strong>people</strong> for <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>support</strong>, while <strong>preserving</strong> their <strong>privacy</strong> and autonomy. <strong>Automated</strong> <strong>rules</strong> and <strong>modes</strong> in some <strong>smart <strong>home</strong></strong> <strong>systems</strong> <strong>perform</strong> <strong>actions</strong> when certain <strong>conditions</strong> are met, like <strong>turning</strong> <strong>devices</strong> on or off when <strong>people</strong> arrive <strong>home</strong>, wake up or leave. And <strong>permissions</strong> in some <strong>smart home</strong> <strong>systems</strong> allow an "<strong>admin</strong>" <strong>user</strong> to grant or deny <strong>access</strong> to certain <strong>devices</strong> to <strong>others</strong> in the <strong>house</strong>, such as controlling <strong>TV/games</strong> console <strong>time</strong> for <strong>children</strong> or locking <strong>cupboards</strong> containing dangerous things. But both of these often fail to take into <strong>account</strong> that real <strong>life</strong>, especially in families, is often messy and unpredictable. It's not always possible to predict which devices will be needed or not needed at different times. And in most families, permissions are often flexible and negotiated. Few <strong>people</strong> enjoy feeling like <strong>sysadmins</strong> for their own homes. Designing for <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> and <strong>services</strong> 
 <strong>Many</strong> connected <strong>products</strong> are <strong><strong>systems</strong></strong> of diverse <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> and <strong>services</strong>. <strong>Functionality</strong> may be distributed across multiple <strong>devices</strong> with different capabilities. <strong>Designers</strong> need to consider how best to distribute <strong>functionality</strong> across devices. They need to design <strong>UIs</strong> and <strong>interactions</strong> across the <strong>system</strong> as a whole <strong>–</strong> not treating <strong>devices</strong> as <strong>standalone</strong> <strong>UIs</strong> <strong>–</strong> to ensure that the overall UX is coherent. This is interusability . And much of the <strong>information processing</strong> for an <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>product</strong> will often happen in the internet service. So the whole <strong>system experience</strong> is often equally or more important than any single <strong>device</strong> UX. <strong>Furthermore</strong>, they need some <strong>understanding</strong> of how the system works. Even quite simple connected products are conceptually more complex than non-connected ones. Code can run in more places. <strong>Parts</strong> of the <strong>system</strong> will inevitably go <strong>offline</strong> from time to time. When this happens, basic <strong>knowledge</strong> of which <strong>component</strong> does what will help <strong>users</strong> understand the <strong>consequences</strong>, and <strong>figure</strong> out what action may be required. Many connected <strong>products</strong> <strong>support automation</strong>, for <strong>example home automation</strong> <strong>rules</strong> that <strong>turn</strong> <strong>devices</strong> on and off in <strong>response</strong> to pre-set triggers. <strong>Users</strong> may have to keep <strong>track</strong> of a <strong>Web</strong> of <strong>interrelationships</strong> between <strong>devices</strong> to predict, understand and fix undesired <strong>clashes</strong> and <strong>strange</strong> behaviors. Over the last 30 <strong>years</strong>, the prevailing <strong>trend</strong> in <strong>UI</strong> <strong>design</strong> has been direct <strong>manipulation</strong> (PDF) . <strong>Users</strong> <strong>control</strong> visual <strong>representations</strong> of <strong>objects</strong> and immediately see the <strong>outcome</strong> of their actions, which can be reversed. But many <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>interactions</strong> are displaced in <strong>location</strong> (<strong>remote control</strong>) or <strong>time</strong> (automation). This breaks the <strong>link</strong> between <strong>user</strong> <strong>actions</strong> and visible, reversible <strong>consequences</strong> we have come to expect from modern <strong>software</strong> (PDF) . <strong>Complex</strong> <strong>products</strong>, like a connected <strong>home system</strong>, can have many <strong>users</strong>, <strong>multiple</strong> <strong>UIs</strong>, many <strong>devices</strong>, many <strong>rules</strong> and applications. Understanding and managing how they all interrelate can be extremely difficult. <strong>Aside</strong> from the <strong>configuration overhead</strong> this <strong>imposes</strong> on <strong>users</strong>, this is a cognitive challenge. Most of us are good at thinking about concrete things. But we are less good at <strong>understanding</strong> <strong>systems</strong> and <strong>interrelationships</strong>, and predicting the <strong>future</strong> <strong>consequences</strong> of our actions. Designing for <strong><strong>network</strong>s</strong> 
 Another major <strong>factor</strong> is the <strong>impact</strong> of the <strong>network</strong> on UX. <strong>Designers</strong> from <strong>Web</strong> and mobile <strong>software</strong> <strong>backgrounds</strong> have the <strong>luxury</strong> of assuming that devices will be nearly always connected. And most <strong>users</strong> understand that sometimes the <strong>internet</strong>, as experienced through <strong>PCs</strong> or mobiles, can be slow, or unreliable. Emails can be slow to download and Skype calls can fail. When <strong>latency</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong> problems do occur, they may be frustrating but are not unexpected, and can be worked around. Our <strong>experience</strong> of the physical <strong>world</strong> is that things respond to us immediately and reliably. <strong>Light</strong> <strong>switches</strong> do not 'lose' our <strong>instructions</strong> or take 30 <strong>seconds</strong> to produce an effect. <strong>Delays</strong> and <strong>glitches</strong> are inherent <strong>properties</strong> of physical <strong>networks</strong> and <strong>transmission</strong> protocols. But they may feel <strong>strange</strong> experienced through 'real <strong>world</strong>' things. It's impossible to <strong>engineer</strong> these <strong>issues</strong> entirely out of any internet-connected <strong>system</strong> (<strong>see</strong> Fig 1-4). [caption id="<strong>attachment_80242</strong>" <strong>align=</strong>"<strong>aligncenter</strong>" <strong>width=</strong>"570"] Fig 1-4. The <strong>design</strong> and <strong>product company</strong> <strong>BERG</strong> produced a beautiful <strong>concept prototype</strong> for a connected washing machine. The <strong>video</strong> shows instant <strong>responses</strong> between the mobile <strong>app</strong> and washing <strong>machine</strong>, running over the Internet. In a real world situation, this could not be guaranteed. <strong>Images</strong>: <strong>Timo Arnall</strong> of BERG. [/caption] 
 <strong>In</strong> <strong>addition</strong>, the <strong>nature</strong> of connected <strong>devices</strong> is that they often connect only intermittently, in <strong>order</strong> to conserve power. <strong>Computers</strong> promise to provide us with precise, accurate and timely <strong>data</strong> about the world around us. But distributed <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>systems</strong> may not always be in <strong>sync</strong>, and different <strong>devices</strong> may therefore <strong>report</strong> different <strong>information</strong> about the <strong>state</strong> of the system. In a distributed <strong>system</strong>, <strong>designers</strong> must often consider <strong>delays</strong>, <strong>discontinuities</strong> and <strong>uncertainty</strong> as <strong>part</strong> of normal <strong>user</strong> interactions and handle them as elegantly as possible.</body>
