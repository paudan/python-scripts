    <body>Cracking the <strong>misconception</strong> that <strong>hacks</strong> are sophisticated and complex by <strong>breaking</strong> down the most common <strong>attack</strong> categories. When it comes to the <strong>world</strong> of <strong>hacking</strong>, <strong>it’s</strong> important to understand not just who a <strong>hacker</strong> is, but also the actual hack itself. Similar to the <strong>assumption</strong> that <strong>hackers</strong> are all <strong>geniuses</strong>, many <strong>people</strong> assume that their methods are similarly complex and sophisticated. But just as <strong>hacker</strong> <strong>skills</strong> range in <strong>sophistication</strong>, their methods do, as well. The most unsophisticated examples typically arise because of human error. <strong>Take</strong>, for <strong>instance</strong>, the password. After each major <strong>login/password breach</strong>, <strong>analysts</strong> review the <strong>data</strong> and find <strong>people</strong> use the same passwords. So much so that upward of 5<strong>%</strong> of <strong>people</strong> use the same 100 passwords. This means that if you wanted to try to hack into someone’s <strong>account</strong>, you have a 1 in 20 <strong>chance</strong> of getting in by just trying the top 100 passwords. As a <strong>quick aside</strong>, this is very easily stopped if <strong>companies</strong> occasionally reviewed the most common <strong>passwords</strong> and didn’t <strong>allow</strong> users to set them. Although there are many <strong><strong>attack</strong></strong> <strong>techniques</strong> that <strong>span sophistication</strong> <strong>levels</strong>, the following is a basic <strong>breakdown</strong> of some of the most common <strong>types</strong> of <strong><strong>attack</strong></strong> <strong>categories</strong>, including examples. <strong>Social</strong> <strong><strong>engineering</strong></strong> 

 <strong>Social</strong> <strong><strong>engineering</strong></strong> <strong>differs</strong> from other <strong>attacks</strong> because it depends on human interaction. Here, the <strong>hacker</strong> manipulates <strong>people</strong> into performing an <strong>action</strong> or divulging confidential information. The hacker relies on people’s natural inclination to help. <strong>It’s</strong> usually easier to trick <strong>someone</strong> into giving <strong>information</strong> rather than hacking for it; for <strong>example</strong>, fooling <strong>someone</strong> into <strong>revealing</strong> a <strong><strong>password</strong></strong>, rather than attempting to brute-force it by running a <strong>computer program</strong> that tests <strong>hundreds</strong> of <strong>thousands</strong> of <strong><strong>password</strong></strong> options automatically. An example of social engineering is phishing . The <strong>hacker</strong> <strong>sends</strong> an <strong>email</strong> that <strong>appears</strong> to come from a legitimate <strong>email</strong> address from a trusted <strong>organization</strong> (a popular <strong>choice</strong> is a <strong>bank</strong>), claiming the recipient <strong>needs</strong> to update a <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong>, and provides a convenient link to click. The <strong>email</strong> might come from a <strong>domain</strong> like <strong>wellsfargo-alerts</strong>@passwordrecovery.com that makes it looks official even though it <strong>doesn’t</strong> come from the <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> <strong>domain</strong>. It looks exactly like past <strong>emails</strong> from <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> all in an attempt to get the recipient to think it’s real. If the recipient <strong>clicks</strong> the <strong>link</strong>, she goes not to the trusted <strong>website</strong> but to the <strong>phisher’s</strong> site, which is designed to look legitimate, and provides her private <strong>information</strong> for the <strong>hacker</strong> to scoop up and then use to gain <strong>access</strong> to the actual account. <strong>Network</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> 

 A <strong>network attack</strong> is when a <strong>hacker</strong> performs an <strong>intrusion</strong> on a <strong>network infrastructure</strong> or host system. The <strong>hacker</strong> analyses the <strong>network address</strong> of the <strong>targets</strong>, takes <strong>advantage</strong> of open <strong>ports</strong> or <strong>vulnerabilities</strong>, and <strong>collects</strong> information. These <strong>attacks</strong> can be passive <strong><strong>(</strong></strong>in which <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> is gathered, but not changed) or active <strong><strong>(</strong></strong>in which <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> is altered); they can occur from within an organization or from outside. An <strong>example</strong> of a <strong>network attack</strong> is a man-in-the-middle attack. Often seen as <strong>MITM</strong>, <strong>MitM</strong>, <strong>MIM</strong>, <strong>MiM</strong> <strong><strong>attack</strong></strong>, or <strong>MITM</strong>A, a man-in-the-middle <strong><strong>attack</strong></strong> is when the <strong>hacker</strong> relays <strong>communication</strong> between two other <strong>parties</strong> using the <strong>opportunity</strong> to capture or modify the <strong>data</strong> (see Figure 1). The two <strong>parties</strong> believe they’re <strong>communicating</strong> with each other, when in <strong>reality</strong>, the <strong>hacker</strong> is intercepting and potentially altering the messages. The <strong>hacker</strong> completely controls the <strong>messages</strong> for his own purposes. This could be to gain financial <strong>information</strong> being relayed to a <strong>bank</strong>, login <strong>information</strong> to a website, or any messages encrypted by a public key. Figure 1. A basic man-in-the-middle attack. <strong>Web</strong> <strong><strong>application</strong></strong> <strong>attacks</strong> 

 A web <strong><strong>application</strong></strong> attack <strong>happens</strong> when a <strong>hacker</strong> <strong>targets vulnerabilities</strong> to a <strong>service</strong> that’s connected to the <strong>Web</strong> (<strong>website</strong>, mobile <strong><strong>application</strong></strong>, <strong>etc</strong>.). <strong>Software</strong> that used to be installed on a <strong>desktop</strong> (for <strong>example</strong>, Microsoft Excel) is rapidly moving to the Internet (Microsoft Office 365 and <strong>Google</strong> <strong>Spreadsheets</strong> are run in a <strong>web browser</strong> instead of a local <strong><strong>computer</strong></strong>) so that you can access and run it on your <strong><strong>computer</strong></strong>, <strong>phone</strong>, or tablet anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, this also means that <strong>hackers</strong> can easily <strong>access</strong> it anywhere in the world, as well. As a <strong>result</strong>, this <strong>type</strong> of <strong>attack</strong> has grown in frequency. The <strong>application layer</strong>, which is easily accessible from the <strong>Internet</strong>, makes it a particularly soft target. A <strong><strong>SQL</strong>i</strong> , or <strong>SQL</strong> <strong>injection attack</strong>, is an <strong>example</strong> of a web application hack. A <strong>hacker</strong> exploits a <strong>code flaw</strong> (also known as a <strong>security bug</strong>) in a <strong>web <strong>application</strong></strong> with malicious <strong>SQL</strong> <strong>statements</strong> that make the <strong>application</strong> potentially <strong>return</strong> any <strong>data</strong> <strong>that’s</strong> available in that website’s <strong>data</strong>base (<strong>passwords</strong>, <strong>credit</strong> <strong>cards</strong>, <strong>addresses</strong>, <strong>etc</strong>.). Although this <strong>type</strong> of <strong>attack</strong> typically <strong>results</strong> in stealing a <strong>copy</strong> of the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> to sell, <strong>attack</strong>ers can also use <strong>SQLi</strong> to tamper with <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, such as <strong>voiding</strong> <strong>transactions</strong> or changing an account balance. And, in some <strong>cases</strong>, the <strong>hacker</strong> can even take over as <strong>administrator</strong> and <strong>controller</strong> of the data. <strong>Endpoint</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> 

 The <strong>endpoints</strong> of a <strong><strong>network</strong> make</strong> them the least <strong>secure</strong>; every <strong>time someone</strong> <strong>connects</strong> a mobile <strong>device</strong> to a corporate <strong>network</strong>, <strong>plugs</strong> in a <strong>USB</strong> drive, or <strong>downloads</strong> an <strong>email attachment</strong>, a potential <strong>hole</strong> in the <strong>network</strong> is created when not done <strong>secure</strong>ly. As soon as a <strong>hole</strong> is created or identified, a <strong>hacker</strong> can take <strong>advantage</strong> and <strong>install malware</strong> onto a network. An advanced <strong>persistent threat</strong> (<strong>APT</strong>) is a <strong>type</strong> of <strong>network attack</strong> that relies on vulnerable endpoints. The <strong>point</strong> of an <strong>APT</strong> is for the <strong>hacker</strong> to stay undetected for as long as possible, keeping <strong>access</strong> to steal a large <strong>amount</strong> of data. The <strong>hacker</strong> must continuously rewrite <strong>code</strong> to stay undetected, making this <strong>type</strong> of attack time consuming and sophisticated. <strong>Wrap-up</strong> 

 Although this <strong>list</strong> of <strong>attack</strong> <strong>categories</strong> includes the most common <strong>methods</strong>, it is by no <strong>means</strong> all-encompassing, nor are <strong>attack</strong> <strong>types</strong> static in nature. As long as there’s <strong>data</strong> <strong>worth</strong> stealing, there will be <strong>people</strong> attempting to get at it by whatever means necessary. The <strong>bar</strong> for how easy or unsophisticated the <strong>hack</strong> is that’s required to break into a system, however, is dependent on how well defended it is. And, unfortunately, that <strong>bar</strong> has been dipping to the <strong>point</strong> where the most basic techniques can be successful. Luckily, many <strong>security</strong> <strong>professionals</strong> are working hard to push the bar back up. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> The <strong>myth</strong> of the sophisticated hack.</body>
