    <body>A new <strong>approach</strong> to <strong>solving</strong> the reproducibility crisis. <strong>Open</strong> <strong>dissemination</strong> of scientific <strong>research</strong> and <strong>data</strong> is a prerequisite for <strong>solving</strong> the reproducibility crisis. The <strong>problem</strong> of low <strong>reproducibility</strong> is plaguing all <strong>disciplines</strong>, but its <strong>impact</strong> is much <strong>worse</strong> in preclinical <strong>research</strong> and development. Further clinical <strong>R</strong>&<strong>D</strong> into <strong>drug</strong> <strong>candidates</strong> and <strong>targets</strong> is turning up wasteful because published <strong>results</strong> can't be replicated (<strong>Freedman</strong> 2015, Begley 2012). There are similar <strong>problems</strong> with clinical <strong>research</strong>: <strong>Drug</strong> <strong>trials</strong> are published with mostly positive <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> supporting the <strong>claims</strong>, and negligible negative <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> (Ioannidis 2015). In this <strong>article</strong>, the <strong>discussion</strong> will mostly remain limited to preclinical <strong>research</strong> outcomes. The <strong><strong>lack</strong></strong> of <strong>replicability</strong> can be attributed to two broad <strong>reasons</strong>: a <strong><strong>lack</strong></strong> of <strong>consensus</strong> on <strong>protocols</strong> being used in <strong>research</strong> <strong>labs</strong> and the <strong>level</strong> of <strong>access</strong> to <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>equipment</strong> required for <strong>performing</strong> experiments. There are numerous <strong>methods</strong> that can be used to solve a <strong>problem</strong>, and domain-specific <strong>researchers</strong> often have their own <strong>versions</strong> of <strong>protocols</strong> which <strong>work</strong> optimally in their lab. This creates obvious <strong>problems</strong> for independent <strong>verification</strong> of <strong>results</strong> and claims. Moreover, not every <strong>lab</strong> has <strong>access</strong> to high-end equipment. Many <strong>researchers</strong> have to substitute lower-end <strong>techniques</strong> which may affect the overall accuracy. To solve these <strong>problems</strong> and standardize <strong>research equipment</strong>, we need the scientific <strong>community</strong> to reach a <strong>consensus</strong> on specific <strong>protocols</strong> and also provide generalized <strong>methods</strong> with sufficient <strong>flexibility</strong> for <strong>minor</strong> substitutions. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> Blockchain-enabled open science framework.</body>
