    <body>Contrary to what many believe, insights are difficult to identify and effectively apply. As the <strong>difficulty</strong> of <strong>insight <strong>generation</strong></strong> becomes <strong>apparent</strong>, we are starting to see <strong>companies</strong> that <strong>offer</strong> <strong>insight <strong>generation</strong></strong> as a service. <strong>Data</strong> <strong>storage</strong>, <strong>management</strong> and <strong>analytics</strong> are maturing into commoditized <strong><strong>services</strong></strong>, and the <strong>companies</strong> that provide these <strong><strong>services</strong></strong> are well-positioned to provide insight on the <strong>basis</strong> not just of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, but <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>access</strong> and other meta<strong><strong>data</strong></strong> patterns. <strong>Companies</strong> like <strong>DataHero</strong> and <strong><strong>Host Analytics</strong> [</strong>full <strong>disclosure</strong>: <strong>Host Analytics</strong> is one of my <strong>portfolio</strong> <strong>companies</strong>] are paving the <strong>way</strong> in the insight-as-a-service space. <strong>Host Analytics</strong>' initial <strong>product offering</strong> was a cloud-based Enterprise Performance Management (<strong>EPM</strong>) Suite, but far more important is what they are now enabling for the <strong>enterprise</strong>: they have moved from being an <strong>EPM</strong> <strong>company</strong> to being an insight generation <strong>company</strong>. In this <strong>post</strong>, I will <strong>discuss</strong> a few of the <strong>trends</strong> that have enabled <strong><strong>insight</strong></strong> as a <strong><strong>service</strong></strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>) and <strong>discuss</strong> the general <strong>case</strong> of using a software-as-a-<strong><strong>service</strong></strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) <strong>EPM</strong> <strong>solution</strong> to corral <strong>data</strong> and deliver <strong><strong>insight</strong></strong> as a <strong><strong>service</strong></strong> as the next <strong>level</strong> of product. <strong>Insight</strong> <strong>generation</strong> is the <strong>identification</strong> of <strong>novel</strong>, interesting, plausi<strong>b</strong>le and understanda<strong>b</strong>le <strong>relations</strong> among <strong>elements</strong> of a <strong>data <strong>set</strong></strong> that a<strong>) lead</strong> to the <strong>formation</strong> of an <strong>action plan</strong> and <strong>b</strong>) <strong>result</strong> in an <strong>improvement</strong> as measured <strong>b</strong>y a <strong>set</strong> of KPIs. The <strong>evaluation</strong> of the <strong>set</strong> of identified <strong>relations</strong> to establish an <strong><strong>insight</strong></strong>, and the <strong>creation</strong> of an <strong>action plan</strong> associated with a particular <strong><strong>insight</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>insight</strong></strong>s, needs to be done within a particular <strong>context</strong> and necessitates the <strong>use</strong> of domain knowledge. <strong>Insight</strong> as a <strong>service</strong> <strong>refers</strong> to <strong>action</strong>-oriented, analytic-driven, cloud-based <strong>solutions</strong> that <strong>generate</strong> <strong>insights</strong> and associated <strong>action</strong> plans. <strong>Insight</strong> as a <strong>service</strong> is a distinct <strong>layer</strong> of the <strong>cloud stack</strong> (I've discussed <strong>IaaS</strong> in earlier posts here and here ). In the <strong>case</strong> of <strong>Host Analytics</strong>, its <strong>EPM</strong> <strong>solution</strong> integrates a <strong>customer</strong>'s financial <strong>planning</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> with <strong>actuals</strong> from their Enterprise Re<strong>source</strong> Planning (ERP) <strong>applications</strong> (<strong>e.g.</strong>, <strong>SAP</strong> or <strong>NetSuite</strong>, and relevant syndicated and open <strong>source</strong> <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>), creating an insight-as-a-service <strong>offering</strong> that complements their existing <strong>solution</strong>. <strong>EPM</strong>, in other <strong>words</strong>, is not just a <strong>matter</strong> of streamlining <strong>data provisions</strong> within the <strong>enterprise</strong>; it's an <strong>opportunity</strong> to provide a true insight generation solution. <strong>EPM</strong> has evolved as a <strong>category</strong> much like the <strong>rest</strong> of the <strong>data</strong> <strong>industry</strong>: from in-house <strong>solutions</strong> for <strong>enterprises</strong> to off-the-shelf but hard-to-maintain <strong>software</strong> to <strong>SaaS</strong> and cloud-based <strong>storage</strong> and access. Throughout this <strong>evolution</strong>, improving the financial <strong>planning</strong>, forecasting, close, and reporting <strong>processes</strong> continue to be a <strong>priority</strong> for corporations. <strong>EPM</strong> started, as many <strong>applications</strong> do, in <strong>Excel</strong> but gave <strong>way</strong> to automated <strong>solutions</strong> starting about 20 <strong>years</strong> ago with the <strong>rise</strong> of <strong>vendors</strong> like <strong>Hyperion</strong> Solutions. <strong>Hyperion</strong>'s <strong>Essbase</strong> was the first to use <strong>OLAP</strong> <strong>technology</strong> to perform both traditional financial <strong>analysis</strong> as well as line-of-business <strong>analysis</strong>. Like many other strategic <strong>enterprise</strong> <strong>applications</strong>, <strong>EPM</strong> started moving to the <strong>cloud</strong> a few years ago. As such, a <strong>corporation</strong>'s financial <strong>data</strong> is now available to easily combine with other <strong>data</strong> <strong>source</strong>s, open <strong>source</strong> and proprietary, and deliver insight-generating solutions. The <strong>rise</strong> of big <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> <strong>—</strong> and the <strong><strong>access</strong></strong> and <strong>management</strong> of such <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> by <strong>SaaS</strong> <strong>applications</strong>, in particular <strong>—</strong> are enabling the <strong>business user</strong> to <strong><strong>access</strong></strong> internal and external <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong>, including public <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong>. As a <strong>result</strong>, it has become possible to <strong>access</strong> the <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> that <strong>companies</strong> really care about, <strong>everything</strong> from the internal financial <strong>numbers</strong> and <strong>sales pipelines</strong> to external <strong>benchmarking</strong> <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> as well as <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> about best practices. Analyzing this <strong>data</strong> to derive <strong>insights</strong> is critical for <strong>corporations</strong> for two reasons. <strong>First</strong>, great <strong>companies</strong> require <strong>agility</strong>, and want to use all the data that's available to them. Second, <strong>company leadership</strong> and corporate <strong>boards</strong> are now requiring more detailed analysis. <strong>Legacy</strong> <strong>EPM</strong> <strong>applications</strong> historically have been centralized in the finance department. This led to several different operational "data hubs" existing within each corporation. Because such <strong>EPM</strong> <strong>solutions</strong> didn't effectively reach all <strong>departments</strong>, critical corporate <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> was "siloed," with critical <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> like <strong>CRM</strong> <strong>data</strong> housed separately from the corporate financial plan. This has left the <strong>departments</strong> to analyze and <strong>report</strong> and <strong>deliver</strong> their <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> to corporate <strong>using</strong> manually integrated <strong>Excel</strong> <strong>spreadsheets</strong> that are incredibly inefficient to <strong>manage</strong> and usually require significant <strong>time</strong> to understand the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>'s <strong>source</strong> and how they were calculated rather than what to do to drive better performance. In most corporations, this data remains disconnected. Understanding the <strong>ramifications</strong> of this <strong>barrier</strong> to <strong>achieving true enterprise performance management</strong>, <strong>IaaS</strong> <strong>applications</strong> are now stretching <strong>EPM</strong> to incorporate operational <strong>functions</strong> like <strong>marketing</strong>, <strong>sales</strong>, and <strong>services</strong> into the planning process. <strong>IaaS</strong> <strong>applications</strong> are beginning to integrate <strong>data sets</strong> from those <strong>departments</strong> to produce a more comprehensive corporate financial <strong>plan</strong>, improving the <strong>plan</strong>ning <strong>process</strong> and helping <strong>companies</strong> better <strong>realize</strong> the <strong>benefits</strong> of <strong>insight</strong> as a service. In this <strong>way</strong> the <strong>CFO</strong>, <strong><strong>VP</strong></strong> of <strong>sales</strong>, <strong>CMO</strong>, and <strong><strong>VP</strong></strong> of <strong>services</strong> can clearly see the <strong>actions</strong> that will improve <strong><strong>performance</strong></strong> in their <strong>departments</strong> and, by <strong>extension</strong>, <strong>elevate</strong> the <strong><strong>performance</strong></strong> of the entire corporation. <strong>Image</strong> on <strong>article</strong> and <strong>category</strong> <strong>pages</strong> via <strong>Wellcome</strong> on Wikimedia Commons .</body>
