    <body>The Web welcomes , but it's awfully big. While <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> may all be appropriate <strong>entry</strong> <strong>points</strong> for <strong>newcomers</strong> who want to create, <strong>finding</strong> a solid starting point can be complicated. Social <strong>media</strong> has minimized the <strong>level</strong> of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong><strong>Web</strong></strong> <strong>knowledge</strong> <strong>people</strong> need to start <strong>contributing</strong>, but when it's <strong>time</strong> to make the <strong>jump</strong>, the <strong><strong>Web</strong></strong> offers perhaps too many options. <strong>Part</strong> of the <strong>challenge</strong> is that <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> may be the <strong>marquee</strong> <strong>technologies</strong>, but they're not actually what <strong>hosts</strong> a website or app. Setting up a site <strong>requires</strong> an additional <strong>set</strong> of <strong>technologies</strong>, from <strong>domain</strong> <strong>names</strong> to hosting to web <strong>server</strong> choices. Setting up a site - long before you get to packaging an app! - <strong>requires</strong> mastering an additional technical <strong>toolset</strong> and vocabulary that will help you navigate where you need to put your projects. Our free <strong>report</strong>, <strong>Getting Started</strong> with the <strong>Web</strong> , provides the <strong>core</strong> foundations beginners need. Those aren't the only barriers, though. Earlier this <strong>year</strong>, <strong>Rachel Andrew</strong> worried that: 
 We're cutting off those easy <strong>entries</strong> into becoming a really good <strong>web developer</strong> because you can use so much stuff now... you read any tutorial and you need <strong>Grunt</strong>, you need all these other <strong>things</strong>, you can't just write CSS. I got into the <strong>Web</strong> just because I wanted to build <strong>websites</strong>, and I viewed <strong>source</strong> and I started building website. You still can do that. I want to make sure there's still those easy <strong>routes</strong> in so that <strong>people</strong> can start <strong>playing</strong> with <strong>things</strong>, and don't feel the <strong>need</strong> to have a huge <strong>stack</strong> of <strong>stuff</strong> before they can write a <strong>line</strong> of HTML. <strong>Tools</strong> are just <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>challenge</strong>, though - the ever-expanding <strong>universe</strong> of <strong>devices</strong> on which <strong>people</strong> view the Web makes it all more daunting. <strong>Andrew</strong> addressed that too : 
 that <strong>battle</strong> about "what do we do with these phones?" ...we sidestepped [making <strong>multiple</strong> <strong>sites</strong>] with responsible <strong>design</strong> but there are still <strong>issues</strong> of <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>things</strong> we're trying to work out as a community. I think it's the best thing we have to tackle the issue. The good <strong>news</strong> on the <strong><strong>device</strong> front</strong> is that <strong>HTML</strong> itself is quite nicely responsive, though creating attractive <strong>formatting</strong> that adjusts itself naturally across <strong>device</strong> contexts is trickier. In some <strong>ways</strong>, though, it's easier to learn responsive <strong>design</strong> early , when you don't have to unlearn past techniques, than to bolt it on later. Getting started right will make it much easier when it's time to optimize. <strong><strong><strong>HTML</strong></strong>5</strong>, which revitalized <strong><strong>HTML</strong></strong> a few <strong>years</strong> ago, started as an <strong>effort</strong> to improve <strong><strong>HTML</strong></strong> form handling, and then grew rapidly beyond that. <strong>Support</strong> for <strong>audio</strong> and <strong>video</strong> removed the <strong>need</strong> for (slow and risky<strong>) browser</strong> plugins just as <strong>Flash</strong>, the main <strong>way</strong> <strong>people</strong> had delivered <strong>multimedia</strong> <strong>content</strong>, was having a very bad few <strong>years</strong> at the <strong>hands</strong> of Apple. Managing large <strong>audio</strong> and <strong>video</strong> <strong>files</strong> remains a <strong>challenge</strong> of its own, but including them in a <strong>document</strong> has become much more like including an <strong>image</strong> in a <strong>document</strong> - manageable. Would you like to learn these <strong>things</strong>, building <strong>sites</strong> (and perhaps eventually apps) that will look good and last through <strong>years</strong> of maintenance? O'Reilly's <strong>HTML5</strong> <strong>Fundamentals</strong> Learning Path can get you started.</body>
