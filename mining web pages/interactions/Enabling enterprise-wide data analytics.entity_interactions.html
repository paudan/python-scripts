    <body>Performing <strong>business</strong> <strong>analytics</strong> on the <strong>data</strong> lake using next-gen open <strong>source</strong> tools. This world is increasingly being driven by quantitative analysis, not qualitative. More than ever, corporate <strong>roles</strong> involved in decision-making <strong>need</strong> to have <strong>access</strong> to <strong>data</strong> and be able to make sense of it. <strong>—</strong> <strong>Thomas Nield</strong> , <strong>revenue management analyst</strong> and self-taught <strong>engineer</strong> at <strong>Southwest</strong> <strong>Airlines</strong> 
 

 <strong>Many</strong> <strong>companies</strong> want to find more <strong>value</strong> by <strong>deploying</strong> <strong>analytics projects</strong> across the entire enterprise. Scaling <strong>analytics</strong> on the <strong>data</strong> lake, however, <strong>presents</strong> some <strong>tool</strong> and skill-related challenges. Primarily, the <strong>data</strong> lake itself is often not safe for <strong>mass use</strong> due to <strong>complexity</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and <strong>governance</strong> issues. As such, <strong>access</strong> to it is usually restricted to <strong>engineering</strong> and IT teams who have the technical <strong>know-how</strong> and permissions to use it. This is not simply an access problem, however. On the <strong>business side</strong>, many <strong>analysts</strong> do not have the <strong>skill</strong> set needed to match <strong>data</strong> to organizational problems. They are also hampered by a <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>awareness</strong> of the <strong>data</strong> or <strong>tools</strong> available that could solve the problems that they’re seeing. As the big <strong>data</strong> <strong>ecosystem</strong> <strong>matures</strong>, <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong> will power their <strong>decisions</strong> with big <strong>data</strong> analytics, but it won’t happen automatically. To get there, <strong>users</strong> need the <strong>right</strong> <strong>tools</strong>, <strong>awareness</strong>, and <strong>skills</strong> to work in the <strong>data ecosystem</strong>, and <strong>companies</strong> need to adopt a  <strong>culture</strong> that <strong>fosters</strong> a creative data mindset. Jumping through the IT bottleneck 

 <strong>For</strong> <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong>, the current <strong>process</strong> for getting <strong>insight</strong> from big data is often long and sometimes frustrating. According to <strong>Dr. Matt North</strong> , who comes from a <strong>risk</strong> <strong>analytics</strong> background at <strong>eBay</strong>, “Business <strong>analysts</strong> are often hogtied when it comes to big <strong>data</strong> and need to go through an IT <strong>approval process</strong> or <strong>sell</strong> their <strong>idea</strong> to their <strong>supervisor</strong> before they go anywhere.” 

 If a <strong>business analyst</strong> wants to set up a <strong>data</strong> feed into <strong>Hadoop</strong> to investigate a particular <strong>business problem</strong> in <strong>detail</strong>, they have to get the <strong><strong>right</strong></strong> <strong>permissions</strong> and make the <strong><strong>right</strong></strong> requests for the <strong>data</strong>. Then, their project becomes IT’s project. Depending on the <strong>department</strong> and the <strong>project’s</strong> <strong>complexity</strong>, this <strong>process</strong> could take weeks, if not longer, to be completed. The asking, waiting, and following up <strong>creates</strong> <strong>friction</strong> and wastes <strong>time</strong> in <strong>deploying</strong> analytics projects. A big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>tool</strong> for many <strong><strong>users</strong></strong> 

 The current <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>access</strong> to <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> reflects the <strong>fact</strong> that most <strong>business</strong> <strong><strong>users</strong></strong> do not have the technical <strong>experience</strong> necessary to use the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lake, which is often built with open <strong>source</strong> <strong>tool</strong>s like <strong>Hadoop</strong> and Spark that are not readily enterprise-friendly. Data lakes are also often disorganized, which makes finding data even more difficult. But big <strong>data</strong> does not have to remain the <strong>domain</strong> of <strong>power</strong> <strong>users—this</strong> is simply a <strong>limitation</strong> of the current tools. There is now a <strong>push</strong> in the <strong>marketplace</strong> to make the <strong>data</strong> lake more accessible to a wide <strong>variety</strong> of users. One <strong>tool</strong> that addresses a <strong>number</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lake <strong>access</strong>, <strong>governance</strong>, <strong>awareness</strong>, and <strong>skill</strong> <strong>issues</strong> is <strong>Kylo</strong> , a soon-to-be open sourced <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lake <strong>orchestration framework</strong> based on <strong>Spark</strong> and NiFi. <strong>Kylo</strong> automates many <strong>functions</strong> related to <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lakes, including <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> ingest, <strong>preparation</strong>, <strong>discovery</strong>, profiling, and management. The <strong>tool</strong> is accessed through a <strong>GUI</strong> <strong>built</strong> with the <strong>business analyst</strong> in <strong>mind</strong>, as well as <strong>modules</strong> for IT <strong>operations</strong> and <strong>data</strong> science. Through Kylo’s <strong>UI</strong>, <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong> can manipulate <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> they care about—creating <strong>feeds</strong>, defining <strong>ingests</strong>, wrangling <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, transforming it, and <strong>publishing</strong> to target systems. They retain <strong>ownership</strong> of the <strong>project</strong> without <strong>needing</strong> to deploy any <strong>code</strong> or turn over <strong>control</strong> to IT, drastically reducing the <strong>amount</strong> of <strong>time</strong> these <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong>project</strong>s tend to take. For <strong>power</strong> <strong>users</strong> such as <strong><strong>data</strong> scientists</strong>, <strong><strong>data</strong> stewards</strong> and IT <strong>operations</strong>, <strong>Kylo</strong> provides <strong>meta<strong>data</strong></strong> tracking, allowing them to make sure <strong>data</strong> is ingesting properly and understand its <strong>accuracy</strong> with Google-like <strong>search</strong> capabilities. These <strong>power</strong> <strong>users</strong> can create <strong>permissions</strong> and readily available <strong>templates</strong> for <strong>business</strong> <strong>analysts</strong> to use, in <strong>addition</strong> to monitoring and enforcing <strong>SLA</strong> policies. Though not a cure-all <strong>(</strong>especially for <strong>companies</strong> with a disorganized <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> lake), <strong>Kylo</strong> and <strong>products</strong> like it are interesting because they allow both <strong>business</strong> and <strong>power</strong> <strong>users</strong> to manipulate big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, bridging the <strong>gap</strong> between big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> skills and access. <strong>Business</strong> <strong>users</strong> get insight faster, and IT can focus on <strong>engineering</strong> and <strong>data</strong> <strong>architecture</strong> <strong>problems</strong> instead of coding <strong>mundane</strong> routines. Making big <strong>data</strong> a <strong><strong>culture</strong> fit</strong> 

 <strong>Company</strong> <strong>culture</strong> should not be underestimated in its <strong>power</strong> to enable <strong>data</strong> analytics at scale. <strong>Successful</strong> data-driven <strong>companies</strong> do this by <strong>fostering</strong> an <strong>environment</strong> of <strong>exploration</strong> and awareness. Adopting such a <strong>culture</strong> relies on <strong>support</strong> from both the top and the <strong>bottom</strong>, whereby <strong>management</strong> <strong>encourages</strong> and <strong>enables</strong> <strong>experimentation</strong>, and <strong>individuals</strong> take initiative to learn about new <strong>tools</strong> and build <strong>products</strong> that solve <strong>problems</strong> of immediate interest to them. Building the <strong>right culture</strong> is a key <strong>step</strong> since, according to <strong>Dr. North</strong>, a <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>awareness</strong> of the <strong>tools</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> available is one of the biggest <strong>challenges</strong> facing at-scale big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>adoption</strong> in the enterprise today. <strong>Tools</strong> like <strong>Kylo</strong> are promising, but they do little good if <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong> don’t know they exist or how to use them. According to <strong>Thomas Nield</strong> at <strong>Southwest</strong> <strong>Airlines</strong>, <strong>“Data</strong> <strong><strong>analyst</strong>s</strong> must be resourceful and driven to not wait on <strong>others</strong> to provide what they need, and to develop <strong>whatever</strong> <strong>means</strong> they need to get <strong>something</strong> that may not even exist, <strong>data</strong> wise.” With <strong>tools</strong> like <strong>Kylo</strong>, for <strong>example</strong>, an <strong>analyst</strong> could discover relevant <strong>data</strong> sets in the <strong>catalog</strong> that he or she could then ingest and prep on their own before <strong>downloading</strong> a <strong>desktop</strong> <strong>analytics</strong> tool to work with them. The open <strong>source ecosystem</strong> is where this <strong>kind</strong> of self-driven <strong>learning</strong> <strong>thrives</strong>, since you don’t need to go through the <strong>process</strong> of acquiring—and <strong>paying for—a</strong> commercial <strong>tool</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to start using it or teaching others how to use it. While more feasible for some <strong><strong>tools</strong></strong> than <strong>others</strong> (for <strong>example</strong>, most <strong>users</strong> probably wouldn’t <strong>run</strong> a <strong>Hadoop</strong> <strong>cluster</strong> on their personal <strong>machine</strong>), the <strong>principle</strong> remains the same: learning new <strong>skills</strong> and <strong><strong>tools</strong></strong> from open <strong>source</strong> can be very enabling, and is becoming increasingly crucial in today’s business environment. <strong>Toward</strong> a <strong>data-ocracy</strong> 

 The <strong>emergence</strong> of <strong>Kylo</strong> and other <strong>tools</strong> like it is paving the <strong>way</strong> for the next <strong>phase</strong> of big data—democratization. There is still a long <strong>way</strong> to go: in the <strong>vendor marketplace</strong>, <strong>tools</strong> need to be improved both to incr<strong>ease</strong> <strong>ease</strong> of <strong>use</strong> as well as to <strong>streamline</strong> <strong>analytics operations</strong>, with the <strong>goal</strong> of efficiently operationalizing <strong>models</strong> in the enterprise. In <strong>order</strong> to adapt, <strong>companies</strong> must embark on <strong>projects</strong> designed to enable <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong> with <strong>awareness</strong> of the <strong>data</strong> and <strong>tools</strong> that are available, <strong>adopt</strong> <strong>products</strong> that <strong>facilitate access</strong>, and <strong>encourage exploration</strong> and skill development. At the same <strong>time</strong>, <strong>business</strong> <strong>users</strong> should be proactive in <strong>searching</strong> out new <strong>tools</strong> and developing skills on their own. As <strong>tools</strong> like <strong>Kylo</strong> <strong>mature</strong>, <strong>everyone</strong> who wants to will be able to use <strong>data</strong> to make their jobs easier or more fun—hopefully both.
