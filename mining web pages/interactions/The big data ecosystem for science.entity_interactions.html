    <body>A <strong>look</strong> at the <strong>data</strong> pipeline <strong>architecture</strong> for five key <strong>NERSC</strong> projects. Large-scale <strong>data</strong> <strong>management</strong> is essential for experimental <strong>science</strong> and has been for many years. <strong>Telescopes</strong>, <strong>particle</strong> <strong>accelerators</strong> and <strong>detectors</strong>, and <strong>gene</strong> <strong>sequencers</strong>, for <strong>example</strong>, <strong>gene</strong>rate <strong>hundreds</strong> of <strong>petabytes</strong> of <strong>data</strong> that must be processed to extract <strong>secrets</strong> and <strong>patterns</strong> in <strong>life</strong> and in the universe. The <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong> technologies</strong> used in these various <strong><strong>science</strong></strong> <strong>communities</strong> often predate those in the rapidly growing <strong>industry</strong> big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>world</strong>, and, in many <strong>cases</strong>, continue to develop independently, occupying a <strong>parallel</strong> big <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> <strong>ecosystem</strong> for <strong><strong>science</strong></strong> (<strong>see</strong> Figure 1). This <strong>post</strong> <strong>highlights</strong> some of these <strong>technologies</strong>, focusing on those used by several <strong>projects</strong> supported by the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Centre (NERSC) . <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> The big <strong>data</strong> <strong>ecosystem</strong> for science.</body>
