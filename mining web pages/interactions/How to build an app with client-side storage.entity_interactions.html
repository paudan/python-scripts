    <body><strong>A​ ​hands-on guide​ ​that​</strong> <strong>​demonstrates</strong> several <strong>storage</strong> <strong>APIs</strong> in action.​ Let’s Build Something! Now   that you’ve <strong>seen multiple</strong> <strong>types</strong> of client-side <strong>storage</strong> <strong>techniques</strong> as well as some <strong>libraries</strong> to help make using them easier, let’s <strong>build</strong> a real, if simple, <strong>application</strong> that makes <strong>use</strong> of some of these <strong>techniques</strong>. Our <strong>application</strong> will be a <strong>tool</strong> for a <strong>company intranet</strong> (“Camden Incorporated”—coming to the <strong>NYSE</strong> soon) that <strong>lets</strong> you search for your coworkers. This could be built using a traditional <strong>application server model</strong>, but we’ve decided to build <strong>something fancy</strong> using <strong>modern web</strong> standards. To make the <strong>search</strong> near instantaneous, we’ll <strong>use</strong> client-side <strong>storage</strong> to keep a <strong>copy</strong> of the <strong>employee database</strong> on the <strong>use</strong>r’s browser. This, of <strong>course</strong>, opens up all <strong>kinds</strong> of interesting issues. First off, how do we handle   synchronization? Companies aren’t static. <strong>People</strong> join or leave <strong>companies</strong> all the time. How often that happens, of <strong>course</strong>, depends on the <strong>company</strong> itself, but obviously you have to consider some <strong>form</strong> of <strong>strategy</strong> for keeping the user’s <strong>copy</strong> of <strong>data</strong> in <strong>sync</strong> with the real <strong>list</strong> on the server. Luckily, in our scenario we don’t have to worry about user edits. The <strong>server side</strong> is always “truth,” which means we can ignore <strong>changes</strong> on the <strong>client side</strong> when syncs happen. For our <strong><strong>demo</strong> we’re</strong> not going to worry about syncing at all, but in a real-world <strong>demo</strong> your <strong>application <strong>server</strong></strong> could provide an <strong>API</strong> where the <strong>client says—and</strong> by <strong>“says” I</strong> mean via <strong>code</strong>, of course—“My <strong>copy</strong> of the <strong>data</strong> was last updated on <strong>October</strong> 10, 2015 at 8:55 AM.” The <strong>server</strong> could then respond with a <strong>set</strong> of <strong>changes</strong> that have occurred since that date. Those <strong><strong>changes</strong></strong> could cover <strong>deletions</strong> (<strong><strong>people</strong></strong> who left the <strong>company</strong>), <strong><strong>changes</strong></strong> (<strong><strong>people</strong></strong> getting married and changing their <strong>name</strong>, or getting new <strong>titles</strong>), and <strong>additions</strong> (new hires). The client-side <strong>code</strong> would apply those <strong>changes</strong> and then make a <strong>note</strong> of the current <strong><strong>time</strong></strong> so that the next <strong><strong>time</strong></strong> it speaks to the <strong>server</strong> it can correctly receive the <strong>changes</strong>. <strong>Continue</strong> <strong>reading</strong> How to build an <strong>app</strong> with client-side storage.</body>
