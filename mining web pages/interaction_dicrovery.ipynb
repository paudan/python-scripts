      " For business users, the current process for getting insight from big data is often long and sometimes frustrating. Depending on the department and the projects complexity, this process could take weeks, if not longer, to be completed. But big data does not have to remain the domain of power usersthis is simply a limitation of the current tools. The tool is accessed through a GUI built with the business analyst in mind, as well as modules for IT operations and data science. Adopting such a culture relies on support from both the top and the bottom, whereby management encourages and enables experimentation, and individuals take initiative to learn about new tools and build products that solve problems of immediate interest to them. The open source ecosystem is where this kind of self-driven learning thrives, since you dont need to go through the process of acquiringand paying fora commercial tool in order to start using it or teaching others how to use it. While more feasible for some tools than others (for example, most users probably wouldnt run a Hadoop cluster on their personal machine), the principle remains the same: learning new skills and tools from open source can be very enabling, and is becoming increasingly crucial in todays business environment. At the same time, business users should be proactive in searching out new tools and developing skills on their own. As tools like Kylo mature, everyone who wants to will be able to use data to make their jobs easier or more funhopefully both. Continue reading Enabling enterprise-wide data analytics.\n",

      "Further clinical R&D into drug candidates and targets is turning up wasteful because published results can't be replicated (Freedman 2015, Begley 2012). There are similar problems with clinical research: Drug trials are published with mostly positive data supporting the claims, and negligible negative data (Ioannidis 2015). In this article, the discussion will mostly remain limited to preclinical research outcomes. The lack of replicability can be attributed to two broad reasons: a lack of consensus on protocols being used in research labs and the level of access to tools and equipment required for performing experiments. To solve these problems and standardize research equipment, we need the scientific community to reach a consensus on specific protocols and also provide generalized methods with sufficient flexibility for minor substitutions.\n",

There are similar problems with clinical research: Drug trials are published with mostly positive data supporting the claims, and negligible negative data (Ioannidis 2015). To solve these problems and standardize research equipment, we need the scientific community to reach a consensus on specific protocols and also provide generalized methods with sufficient flexibility for minor substitutions.\n",

      "Close the time gap between analysis and action to bring about the next wave of improvements in efficiency and reliabilityand magic. Embracing real time is the only option for companies seeking to elevate both the speed and the quality of information their business is analyzing. The world of renewable energy is a perfect example of the possibilitiesand challengesof the 21st-century economy. In a transportation firm, for example, data analytics may be able to recommend new truck routes given traffic conditions. The first step to speeding up the time-to-delivered-insight is real-time data access and insights dashboards. As we replace fossil fuels with renewables (solar, wind, and hydro), and seek to use less energy overall, it is clear that the interplay of numerous machines, human analysts, and timescales necessitate real-time data pipelines. While it takes a half hour or so to spin up a natural-gas turbine, solar panels and wind turbines depend on the weather; hydroelectric plants can be brought online in minutes, but need to pay attention to the long-term seasonal cycles of rain and snowfall, irrigation needs, and even fish migration. For example, one Internet of Things simulated application that tracks the status of nearly 200,000 wind turbines around the world shows how real-time data can empower businesses in the energy sector.

ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Logstash, which is in the front, is responsible for giving structure to your data (like parsing unstructured logs) and sending it to Elasticsearch. Why is it so useful for dealing with logs? Having hundreds of servers running different applications, virtual machines, containersall that adds up to a lot of data that needs to be analyzed when problems happen or when you need to understand how things work. Being able to narrow down your data or easily find the information you are looking for really helps with operations-related tasks. Adding metrics to the equation gives you even more visibility compared to logs only. I think there are two main things that make ELK so popular and different.

Another part of the answer to your question is what I call the shared spiritual ancestry of both, or, as a colleague phrased it: They are twins separated at birth. Kubernetes directly builds on Google's decade-long experience with their own cluster scheduling system, Borg. While Google engineers certainly still live far in the future, I daresay that the technological differences to normal mid-size tech companies are much less fundamental these days. The existence of the many Google-inspired tools and technologies out there are in a way both a cause and a consequence of that development. Another source of inspiration are the many whitepapers Googlers have published (like the aforementioned GFS and MapReduce papers) or just the brains of ex-Googlers that miss the awesome infrastructure after leaving the company. (Rumors that Google would use Men-in-Black-style neuralyzers during offboarding are strongly exaggerated.) Not only are single-host failures increasingly likely in large distributed systems, but those systems are explicitly designed to tolerate single-host failures. In the words of Rob Ewaschuk , symptom-based alerting is preferred over cause-based alerting. At the same time, you still need to be able to drill down to explore causes.

      "Without a great deal of forethought into testing and edge cases, you can end up in a situation where your data science application is behaving in a way you did not expect and cannot explain (e.g., because the behavior is caused by errors that were unexpected and unhandled). As soon as a data science application breaks down without explanation, people wont trust it and, thus, will cease making data-driven decisions based on insights from the application. In contrast, heavy-weight Python data science applications may need readability-killing packages like Twisted to fit into modern event-driven systems and likely rely on an ecosystem of tooling that takes significant effort to deploy. Because Go is statically typed and because the Go community encourages and teaches handling errors gracefully , data scientists exploiting these features can have confidence in the applications and services they deploy. In the world of Python or R, errors may hide themselves behind convenience. Finally, engineers and devops already love Go. The point is not that Go is perfect for every scenario imaginable, so data scientists should use Go, or that Go is fast and scalable (which it is), so data scientists should use Go. Moreover, data scientists really should love Go, as it alleviates their main struggles while still providing them the tooling to be productive, as we will see below (with the added benefits of efficiency, scalability, and low memory usage). Sure, they get to train a machine learning model on occasion, but there are a huge number of business problems that can be solved via some data gathering/organization/cleaning and aggregation/statistics. Thus, in order to be productive in Go, data scientists must be able to gather data, organize data, parse values, and do arithmetic and statistics. Also, keep in mind that, as gophers, we want to produce clear code over being clever (a feature which also helps us as scientists or data scientists/engineers) and introduce a little copying rather than a little dependency.
