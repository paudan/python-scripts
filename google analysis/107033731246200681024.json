      "content": "How fragile life is, even for the best of us. We heard this morning that our friend Jake Brewer was killed yesterday in a bike accident.\u00a0 I try to take comfort in poetry. I have always loved Wallace Stevens' thoughts in Esthetique du Mal in moments like this: \"He breathes a summer sleep, In which his wound is good because life was. No part of him was ever part of death.\" And yes, there is somehow a deep continuity, in which we all one way or another come to that moment of our undoing, and our end is just one more part of a good life. None of us know when it will be. So we have to make the most of each moment - and that's what Jake did, throwing himself into life, fully. But it's still a tragedy. Edna St Vincent Millay captured that tragedy perfectly in Dirge without Music: \"I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground. So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind: Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned. Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you. Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust. A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew, A formula, a phrase remains,\u2014but the best is lost. The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\u2014 They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve. More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world. Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind; Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\"\ufeff",

What's the Future of Work? \u00a0It's a look at robots, AI, and the on-demand economy, and what they tell us about the future of work, the shape of corporations, and the issues we should be grappling with now if we want these profound changes to come out for the best. My co-host for the event is Steven Levy of Medium. While the speaker list is still preliminary, it tells the story of what we're going after. Explore the speaker pages - I've loaded them with quotes from the speakers, which will help you understand in advance where they are coming from. Over the next few weeks and months, we'll be curating an online conversation, with lots of great reading and viewing, to engage with these ideas, whether or not you are coming to the event.\ufeff",

      "content": "Absolutely fascinating exploration of the microbiome of a city. For those who don't know what the microbiome is, the article defines it with some interesting statistics: \"Typically, every person is home to about a hundred trillion microbial cells bearing five million different genes, totaling about 5 pounds of micro-organisms per person. Indeed, microbes in and on the body outnumber human cells about 10 to one. \u201cYou are a minority party in the democracy of the body,\u201d Dr. Mason said. \"The body\u2019s collection of microbes, called the microbiome, influences health in ways that researchers are only beginning to understand. They may be key to proper digestion, vitamin synthesis and brain function, new research suggests. Changes among the millions of microbes living in the human stomach also may promote obesity, trigger ulcers or affect how well a flu vaccine works.\" The article describes a research project to explore signs of this microbiome expressed on surfaces throughout the NYC subways. My two favorite quotes: \u201cA city is like an organism,\u201d said IBM Corp. computational biologist Robert Prill, who is among those at the company investigating ways to better collect and analyze these immense new public-health genome databases. \u201cIt has a circulating system consisting of the movement of people.\u201d and \u201cWe know next to nothing about the ecology of urban environments,\u201d said evolutionary biologist Jonathan Eisen at the University of California at Davis. \u201cHow will we know if there is something abnormal if we don\u2019t know what normal is?\u201d\ufeff",

      "content": "This was my favorite piece in this Sunday's New York Times. It's a fascinating article about CBW, a tiny bank in Kansas, that has become a laboratory for financial innovation with a focus on better user experience. \"The creation of the new bank, and the maintenance of the old one, are the work of a couple who were born in India and ended up in Kansas after living in Silicon Valley and passing through jobs at Google and Lehman Brothers.... \"Their work is an unusual experiment: a new kind of mom-and-pop business trying to reshape a highly regulated and innovation-resistant industry. The new services that CBW is providing, like instant payments to any bank in the United States, direct remittance transfers abroad and specialized debit cards, might seem as if they should be painless upgrades in an age of high-frequency trading and interplanetary space missions. But with most banks, it still takes longer to send money to another country or even to another state than it does to travel the same distance.\" I was particularly struck by this paragraph, which reminded me of the fundamental game plan that we practice on government with the Code for America Fellowship: \"As he and his wife had hoped, buying an established institution allowed them to examine how money transfers and payment technology worked in a traditional bank \u2014 something that was hard to see in detail from the outside \u2014 and to consider how to make changes. \"His first discovery was that nearly all banks rely on a few big, and not terribly agile, outside vendors to provide all the software that makes bank computer systems work. Mr. Ramamurthi found a small technology provider that would be more flexible and allow him to begin tweaking the software....\" Get inside, figure out how it works now. Then start to iterate towards change, making the institution more flexible, and able to meet real user needs.\ufeff",

If anyone has ideas about how we can validate young people in other countries, we can explore adding them. \u00a0 + Andrew Savikas \u00a0explains how this came about. Congratulations to the Safari team, especially + Keith Fahlgren , who took the bit in his teeth and figured out how to make this happen. \u00a0I particularly like how the Safari team figured out how to make this an internet self-service play rather than something we had to work through bureaucratic channels. And thanks to the folks at the White House, who used their convening power to get a whole lot of donations to help kickstart better STEM education in America.\ufeff",

It is a moving piece about the magic of Ireland. Incidentally, the painting of Torc Mountain referred to in the story was by Sean O'Connor. \u00a0We were eating dinner in a room filled with O'Connor's paintings, which is what led Johny McGuire to inquire about James' story. And if you've seen my photos from Killarney over the past couple of days, the distinctive shape of Torc can be seen in many of them.\ufeff",

I shared Blaise Pascal's famous line, \"I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter\" and told the story I'd heard attributed to\u00a0Woodrow Wilson. \u00a0When asked how long it took him to prepare for a five minute speech, he said \"About two weeks.\" \u00a0Astonished listener: \"Well, then, how long does it take you to prepare for an hour-long speech?\" Wilson: \u00a0\"Oh, I could do that right now.\" But I think she topped me with her anecdote, apparently from a priest who said it about his technique for writing sermons.\ufeff",

If it were consistent with the Obama open data guidance, that RFP would require an API so that independent companies could provide alternate interfaces, just like travel sites provide booking interfaces for air travel, hotels, and more.\u00a0 Unfortunately, as drafted, the RFP allows the winning contractor to determine whether an API is feasible \u2014 meaning the company that benefits most from keeping all the reservations to itself \u00a0has the authority to do so. And the draft even removes data that is currently accessible \u2014 availability data \u2014 from public sharing. So, it\u2019s a huge step backward, and completely out of step with the administration\u2019s open data policy. The founder of Hipcamp, Alyssa Ravasio, has written up some thoughts on how this RFP could be improved that I want to share with you. And after reading them, I\u2019m hoping you will be moved to send comments asking the Department of the Interior to reconsider their RFP. Comments on this draft are accepted via email to jasonmking@fs.fed.us through Wednesday October 22. Please send your comments.\ufeff",

      "content": "Can We Use Data to Make Better Regulations? Evgeny Morozov either misunderstands or misrepresents the key point of my piece on Algorithmic Regulation. \u00a0In his recent New Yorker article about big data and regulation, he summarizes my view as \"collect as much relevant data from as many sources as possible, analyze them in real time, and make an optimal decision based on the current circumstances rather than on some idealized projection.\" In fact, my article is about building regulations that do a better job of achieving their \u00a0long term idealized outcome! \u00a0Morozov has \u00a0got it precisely backwards. Here's what I actually said on the subject. \u00a0The article opens: \"Regulation is the bugaboo of today\u2019s politics. We have too much of it in most areas, we have too little of it in others, but mostly, we just have the wrong kind, a mountain of paper rules, inefficient processes, and little ability to adjust the rules or the processes when we discover the inevitable unintended results. \"Consider, for a moment, regulation in a broader context. Your car\u2019s electronics regulate the fuel-air mix in the engine to find an optimal balance of fuel efficiency and minimal emissions. An airplane\u2019s autopilot regulates the countless factors required to keep that plane aloft and heading in the right direction. Credit card companies monitor and regulate charges to detect fraud and keep you under your credit limit. Doctors regulate the dosage of the medicine they give us, sometimes loosely, sometimes with exquisite care, as with the chemotherapy required to kill cancer cells while keeping normal cells alive, or with the anesthesia that keeps us unconscious during surgery while keeping vital processes going. ISPs and corporate mail systems regulate the mail that reaches us, filtering out spam and malware to the best of their ability. Search engines regulate the results and advertisements they serve up to us, doing their best to give us more of what we want to see. \"What do all these forms of regulation have in common? \"A deep understanding of the desired outcome \"Real-time measurement to determine if that outcome is being achieved \"Algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that make adjustments based on new data \"Periodic, deeper analysis of whether the algorithms themselves are correct and performing as expected. \"There are a few cases\u2014all too few\u2014in which governments and quasi-governmental agencies regulate using processes similar to those outlined above. Probably the best example is the way that central banks regulate the money supply in an attempt to manage interest rates, inflation, and the overall state of the economy. Surprisingly, while individual groups might prefer the US Federal Reserve to tighten or loosen the money supply at a different time or rate than they do, most accept the need for this kind of regulation. \"Why is this? \"The desired outcomes are clear \"There is regular measurement and reporting as to whether those outcomes are being achieved, based on data that is made public to everyone \"Adjustments are made when the desired outcomes are not being achieved \"Contrast this with the normal regulatory model, which focuses on the rules rather than the outcomes. How often have we faced rules that simply no longer make sense? How often do we see evidence that the rules are actually achieving the desired outcome?\" ( http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/ ).\ufeff",

So I was excited to see an interview with her in the Sunday New York Times .\u00a0 It wasn't as good as I hoped - authors rarely live up to their books - but it got better as it went along (read to the end!) and \u00a0there were a couple of gems: \"people are too poorly suited to life in the world for this to be the definitive human condition.\" Lovely. And she also quotes one of the many lovely lines from Gilead : \"It all means more than I can tell you. So you must not judge what I know by what I find words for.\"\ufeff",

(The chickens roost over a wire frame, and the dung piles up underneath, with some cleanout doors so we can dig it out for the garden.) Clem took some Foo Camp t-shirts, and modded them with some paint so they read \"poo camp,\" \u00a0and turned the tent with wifi logo into a steaming pile. Then we set to work. \u00a0Jen dug out the accumulated droppings, while Clem made sure it was all extra fresh for the chickens (who will immediately befoul it again.) \u00a0I dug some aged manure into a garden bed, and then Jen put the fresher stuff into the compost pile. Jen poked fun at some of my popular slogans \u00a0by saying that this was \"Work on fecal matter\" or \"Create more droppings than Tim can capture\", while I riposted that it was better called \"Work on shit that matters.\" \u00a0 + Nat Torkington \u00a0, who saw Jen's tweet, suggested \"Work on stuff that splatters.\" \u00a0Marc Hedlund topped us all with \"our mission is spreading the fertilizer of aviators.\" \u00a0All in good fun, but it's also true that composting does matter!\ufeff",

It seems to me to be the most interesting thing happening in Silicon Valley today. It is getting smarter by leaps and bounds, and is pointing us towards a whole new way of interacting with computers. \u00a0The combination of Google Now voice control with a smart watch running Google Wear has been truly transformative for the way I interact with applications and devices. What I'm waiting for is a better \"user programming model.\" \u00a0Google Now or Siri plus IFTTT. \u00a0Speech brings us back to the command line, and the Unix Shell was the most powerful command line I've used. I loved how it seduced people into programming. \u00a0Anything could be a command, and you could combine them into new \"scripts\" (sentences if you will), that then could become first class verbs of their own. \u00a0It is the ideal model for the speech system of the future: \u00a0a constrained vocabulary to begin with, but ultimate customizability. Just like spoken and written language itself.\u00a0 Of course, I didn't say all that in the post below. But it's the thinking behind my handicapping Google way ahead of Apple in this horse race.\ufeff",

I'm also thinking of past and present Code for America partners at the city level. Jascha Franklin Hodge in Boston, Teresa Reno Webber in Louisville, Beth Niblock in Detroit, and Rick Cole, Peter Marx, and Abhi Nemani in LA all come to mind. There are so many people in government who are hungry for new ways of doing things. They went into public service to make a difference, and they want help from private sector partners who are working with 21st century technology and business models. The outside game has largely consisted of nonprofits like Code for America and Datakind, but now increasingly we are seeing commercial companies who are bringing new ways of thinking to government projects.

It's a disastrous bug. Making me think about switching to another phone, even though I love this one. \u00a0And it seems to have been introduced only in the past month or so, as the phone worked fine with the car before that.

We have a delivery crisis!\" \u00a0We endlessly promote new policies that are supposed to fix everything, but pay little attention to what it will take to actually implement them. In an In an interview with Charlie Rose, Steven Brill said something similar about the failure of healthcare.gov in the disconnect between policy and implementation: \u201cThe way they managed this program, it was almost as if they thought that actual governing, the nuts and bolts of governing, is for peons. And they are policy people.\u201d (See http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj ) In this particular case, there is little or no teacher training, no supervision:\u00a0 \"The trouble always starts when teachers are told to put innovative ideas into practice without much guidance on how to do it. In the hands of unprepared teachers, the reforms turn to nonsense, perplexing students more than helping them....\" \"With the Common Core, teachers are once more being asked to unlearn an old approach and learn an entirely new one, essentially on their own. Training is still weak and infrequent, and principals \u2014 who are no more skilled at math than their teachers \u2014 remain unprepared to offer support. Textbooks, once again, have received only surface adjustments, despite the shiny Common Core labels that decorate their covers.\" By contrast, Japan took not just the ideas of how to teach math better, but also put those ideas carefully and thoroughly into practice. \u00a0 \"In Japan, teachers had always depended on jugyokenkyu, which translates literally as \u201clesson study,\u201d a set of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft. A teacher first plans lessons, then teaches in front of an audience of students and other teachers along with at least one university observer. Then the observers talk with the teacher about what has just taken place. Each public lesson poses a hypothesis, a new idea about how to help children learn. And each discussion offers a chance to determine whether it worked. Without jugyokenkyu, it was no wonder the American teachers\u2019 work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers. Without jugyokenyku, Takahashi never would have learned to teach at all. Neither, certainly, would the rest of Japan\u2019s teachers.\" This is a must-read piece if you care about education, or even just, if like many parents, you are struggling to help your own children make up for the terrible math education they are getting in school.\ufeff",

      "content": "+ Maria Konnikova 's NY Times article about the role of time and attention scarcity in the cycle of poverty was arresting and important. It really echoed some of the issues that we've seen at + Code for America \u00a0- there's a section at the end of the article that is going to be quoted often by people involved in the business of improving government services: \"If poverty is about time and mental bandwidth as well as money, how does this change how we combat its effects? 'When we think about programs for the poor, we don\u2019t ever think, hey, let\u2019s give them programs that don\u2019t use a lot of bandwidth,' says Mr. Mullainathan. Instead, we fault people for failing to sign up for programs that are ostensibly available, even though we don\u2019t factor in the time and cognitive capacity they need to get past even the first step. \u201c'If I give people a very complicated form, it\u2019s a big demand on cognitive capacity,' Mr. Shafir says. 'Take something like the Fafsa' \u2014 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 'Why is pickup for the low-income families less than 30 percent? People are already overwhelmed, and you go and give them an incredibly complicated form.' \"To him, the obvious conclusion is to radically change our thinking. 'Just like you wouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 to fill out a form, you shouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 in cognitive complexity,' he says. One study found that if you offer help with filling out the Fafsa form, pickup goes up significantly.\" It starts with empathy Jake Solomon has another take on the issue, which he explains so well in his post People, Not Data \u00a0 https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 about the work he and the other Code for America fellows in San Francisco did last year to simplify the compliance for Food Stamp recipients. \u00a0 What I love about Maria's article, though, is that it gives another way of thinking about why complex government forms are even worse than they appear, especially when it comes to providing services to people least able to deal with them.\ufeff",

      "content": "\"We don't need new policies. We need better implementation.\" Last night, I hosted Oakland City Councilor and mayoral candidate Libby Schaaf at a house party to introduce her to my neighbors. In response to a question about what to do about one of Oakland's many problems, she said \"We don't need new policies. \u00a0We need better implementation.\" \u00a0And in response to a question about disengaged city employees, she talked about the ones who really want to make a difference, and are just waiting to be activated. That resonated so strongly with me, because just the night before, I'd been at a talk by\u00a0 + Mikey Dickerson \u00a0about the healthcare.gov rescue effort, which sounded almost exactly the same notes. \u00a0It's easy to imagine heroic Silicon Valley coders riding to the rescue, but Mikey pointed out that they wrote very little code. \u00a0Much of the rescue work was done by the same people who built the broken site. \u00a0What the Silicon Valley team provided was clear management focus from people who knew what they were doing. They were able to debug all the bad process and broken communications between the various contractors who'd built the site, figure out what they needed from each of them, and then encourage and bring out the best in those people. They also had the guts and the force of will to get the recalcitrants on board. \u00a0(I wrote more about this at\u00a0 http://bit.ly/healthcare_rescue ) So much of the work we do at Code for America is drawn from the same playbook (though we usually don't have the kind of mandate that the \"Code Red\" healthcare.gov rescue team did!) \u00a0It's about debugging a process, making small tech interventions, but even more about helping \"the system\" to work better by understanding needs and figuring out why they aren't being met. \u00a0(See for example Jake Solomon's brilliant post about his work in San Francisco last year:\u00a0 https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 ) We have a constant parade of politicians who tell us what we want to hear: that they have a new policy idea, and that if we follow their advice, everything will be great. \u00a0This kind of \"magic bullet\" thinking is what gets us the same dismal results, over and over. \u00a0To be sure, there are times when we do need new policies, and I'm sure Libby has her share of policy ideas too. \u00a0But getting away from policy and digging into implementation is so important! So much of the problem isn't what we set out to do, it's how we do it. \u00a0I love hearing someone speak truth about that. P.S.\u00a0As a city councilor, Libby is in a non-executive role. \u00a0If she is in charge of actual implementation, I'm super-excited to see what she can do. \u00a0If you're an Oakland city resident, I hope you turn out and vote for her in November. \u00a0If you'd like to learn more, I'm co-hosting another, bigger event for Libby at the new (still under construction) BlueSprout Maker space in Oakland next Sunday. \u00a0Sign up to attend here: http://www.eventbrite.com/e/libbyraiser-tickets-11878702519 \ufeff",

      "content": "Great talk by Maciej Ceglowski. \u00a0Funny, smart, and with an important message. \u00a0Just like Maciej all around. \u00a0It is too long since I've spent time with him! I loved his thoughts on regulation, quoted below. \u00a0I don't agree with his initial statement that it should be \"illegal to collect\" certain kinds of data but do agree that it should be \"illegal to permanently store\" it. I think that's what he thinks too, if you read on beyond that first line. REGULATE It should be illegal to collect and permanently store most kinds of behavioral data. In the United States, they warn us the world will end if someone tries to regulate the Internet. But the net itself was born of a fairly good regulatory framework that made sure de facto net neutrality existed for decades, paid for basic research into protocols and software, cleared the way for business use of the internet, and encouraged the growth of the commercial web. It's good regulation, not lack of regulation, that kept the web healthy. \t Here's one idea for where to begin: 1. Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing\u2014your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you're using. It's very important that we regulate this at the database, not at the point of collection. People will always find creative ways to collect the data, and we shouldn't limit people's ability to do neat things with our data on the fly. But there should be strict limits on what you can save. 2. Limit how long they can keep it. Maybe three months, six months, three years. I don't really care, as long as it's not fifty years, or forever. Make the time scale for deleting behavioral data similar to the half-life of a typical Internet business. 3. Limit what they can share with third parties. This limit should also apply in the event of bankruptcy, or acquisition. Make people's data non-transferable without their consent. \t 4. Enforce the right to download. If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it. The EU already mandates this to some extent, but it's not evenly enforced. This rule is a little sneaky, because it will require backend changes on many sites. Personal data can pile up in all kinds of dark corners in your system if you're not concerned about protecting it. But it's a good rule, and easy to explain. You collect data about me? I get to see it. 5. Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups. \t 6. Give privacy policies teeth. Right now, privacy policies and terms of service can change at any time. They have no legal standing. For example, I would like to promise my users that I'll never run ads on my site and give that promise legal weight. That would be good marketing for me. Let's create a mechanism that allow this. 7. Let users opt-in if a site wants to make exceptions to these rules. If today's targeted advertising is so great, you should be able to persuade me to sign up for it. Persuade me! Convince me! Seduce me! You're supposed to be a master advertiser, for Christ's sake! 8. Make the protections apply to everyone, not just people in the same jurisdiction as the regulated site. It shouldn't matter what country someone is visiting your site from. Keep it a world-wide web.\ufeff",

      "content": "The Myth of the Spoiled Child There is an interesting op-ed in the NY Times by Alfie Cohn, who has written a new book, The Myth of the Spoiled Child . The article opens: \"THE conventional wisdom these days is that kids come by everything too easily \u2014 stickers, praise, A\u2019s, trophies. It\u2019s outrageous, we\u2019re told, that all kids on the field may get a thanks-for-playing token, in contrast to the good old days, when recognition was reserved for the conquering heroes. \"Children are said to be indulged and overcelebrated, spared from having to confront the full impact of their inadequacy. There are ringing declarations about the benefits of frustration and the need for grit. \"These themes are sounded with numbing regularity, yet those who sound them often adopt a self-congratulatory tone, as if it took extraordinary gumption to say pretty much what everyone else is saying. Indeed, this fundamentally conservative stance on children and parenting has become common even for people who are liberal on other issues.\" While I most certainly agree with the premise of the article, that unconditional love is best for kids, and that, as Cohn says: \"Over the last decade or so, two Israeli researchers, Avi Assor and Guy Roth, and their colleagues in the United States and Belgium, have conducted a series of experiments whose consistent finding is that when children feel their parents\u2019 affection varies depending on the extent to which they are well behaved, self-controlled or impressive at school or sports, this promotes \u201cthe development of a fragile, contingent and unstable sense of self.\u201d' and \"Kids shouldn\u2019t be spared struggle and sacrifice, regardless of the effects. The second value is scarcity: the belief that excellence, by definition, is something that not everyone can attain. No matter how well a group of students performs, only a few should get A\u2019s. Otherwise we\u2019re sanctioning \u201cgrade inflation\u201d and mediocrity. To have high standards, there must always be losers. \"But it\u2019s the third conviction that really ties everything together: an endorsement of conditionality. Children ought never to receive something desirable \u2014 a sum of money, a trophy, a commendation \u2014 unless they\u2019ve done enough to merit it. They shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to feel good about themselves without being able to point to tangible accomplishments. In this view, we have a moral obligation to reward the deserving and, equally important, make sure the undeserving go conspicuously unrewarded.\" There is also something odd in the framing of the article, which comes across as a defense of all the faux rewards that are given in the name of self-esteem, when in fact, I think Cohn's whole career and his previous books (e.g. the classic Punished by Rewards ) emphasizes the downside of what is now called \"gamification\" and instead argues for intrinsic motivation. So it is important not to read this piece too quickly, but instead to think about what (I think) he is really saying: * Focus on giving your kids unconditional love, unblemished by either punishment or rewards * But don't be afraid of giving them encouragement * And don't buy into the idea that to be self-motivated, they need to get \"tough love.\" I know Cohn's thought is interesting and complex, and without knowing his previous work, I could easily see people being confused by what he was trying to say here, thinking that it is a defense of \"helicopter parents.\" \u00a0Which I don't think it is...\u00a0\ufeff",

      "content": "How to Raise Moral Children I thought this article on child-raising had a lot of good ideas in it. \u00a0There was stuff that was new to me, and stuff that was old, but the old stuff was worth reviewing, and the new research quite enlightening. Do read the article even if you don't have children.\u00a0The principles it outlines apply to our lives as adults as well, to leadership in the workplace and in the world. \u00a0And while I've reproduced many of the best bits below, it's well worth going to the article itself, because it is heavily linked to the original research. What matters most is not achievement but caring The article opened with the familiar advice that\u00a0\"when parents praise effort rather than ability, children develop a stronger work ethic and become more motivated.\" \u00a0But it went from there in a surprising direction: \"When people in 50 countries were asked to report their guiding principles in life, the value that mattered most was not achievement, but caring.\" Contrary to popular advice, praise of character is more effective than praise of behavior \"Many parents believe it\u2019s important to compliment the behavior, not the child \u2014 that way, the child learns to repeat the behavior. Indeed, I know one couple who are careful to say, 'That was such a helpful thing to do,' instead of, 'You\u2019re a helpful person.'\" But that's not what the research shows: \"...A couple of weeks later, when faced with more opportunities to give and share, the children were much more generous after their character had been praised than after their actions had been. Praising their character helped them internalize it as part of their identities. The children learned who they were from observing their own actions: I am a helpful person. This dovetails with new research led by the psychologist Christopher J. Bryan, who finds that for moral behaviors, nouns work better than verbs. To get 3- to 6-year-olds to help with a task, rather than inviting them 'to help,' it was 22 to 29 percent more effective to encourage them to 'be a helper.' Cheating was cut in half when instead of, 'Please don\u2019t cheat,' participants were told, 'Please don\u2019t be a cheater.' When our actions become a reflection of our character, we lean more heavily toward the moral and generous choices. Over time it can become part of us.\" I think this is an important insight. \u00a0Internalizing our experiences and making them part of our identity is a key element of growing up.\u00a0 Note: \u00a0\"by the time children turned 10, the differences between praising character and praising actions vanished: Both were effective. Tying generosity to character appears to matter most around age 8, when children may be starting to crystallize notions of identity.\" I will note that the advice for dealing with bad behavior (as opposed to good behavior) is just the opposite: \u00a0to emphasize the behavior, and not the character. \u00a0You don't want a kid to internalize the idea that he or she is a bad person! \u00a0That was the next key point, the distinction between guilt and shame. \"If we want our children to care about others, we need to teach them to feel guilt rather than shame when they misbehave.\" This is a fascinating distinction: \u00a0 \"When children cause harm, they typically feel one of two moral emotions: shame or guilt. Despite the common belief that these emotions are interchangeable, research led by the psychologist June Price Tangney reveals that they have very different causes and consequences. \"Shame is the feeling that I am a bad person, whereas guilt is the feeling that I have done a bad thing. Shame is a negative judgment about the core self, which is devastating: Shame makes children feel small and worthless, and they respond either by lashing out at the target or escaping the situation altogether. In contrast, guilt is a negative judgment about an action, which can be repaired by good behavior. When children feel guilt, they tend to experience remorse and regret, empathize with the person they have harmed, and aim to make it right.\" ... \"The most effective response to bad behavior is to express disappointment. According to independent reviews by Professor Eisenberg and David R. Shaffer, parents raise caring children by expressing disappointment and explaining why the behavior was wrong, how it affected others, and how they can rectify the situation. This enables children to develop standards for judging their actions, feelings of empathy and responsibility for others, and a sense of moral identity, which are conducive to becoming a helpful person. The beauty of expressing disappointment is that it communicates disapproval of the bad behavior, coupled with high expectations and the potential for improvement: 'You\u2019re a good person, even if you did a bad thing, and I know you can do better.'\" Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do. \"In a classic experiment, the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton gave 140 elementary- and middle-school-age children tokens for winning a game, which they could keep entirely or donate some to a child in poverty. They first watched a teacher figure play the game either selfishly or generously, and then preach to them the value of taking, giving or neither. The adult\u2019s influence was significant: Actions spoke louder than words. When the adult behaved selfishly, children followed suit. The words didn\u2019t make much difference \u2014 children gave fewer tokens after observing the adult\u2019s selfish actions, regardless of whether the adult verbally advocated selfishness or generosity. When the adult acted generously, students gave the same amount whether generosity was preached or not \u2014 they donated 85 percent more than the norm in both cases. When the adult preached selfishness, even after the adult acted generously, the students still gave 49 percent more than the norm. Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.\" So true. \u00a0As I said above, all of this applies to adults too.\u00a0\ufeff",

      "content": "Journalism vs. Punditry: NPR's Kelly McEvers on Why Reporting Matters There was a great segment on KQED Forum the other day with NPR correspondent Kelly McEvers. \u00a0Throughout the segment, she talked about the power of reporting. \u00a0She tells the story of when she was called to Bahrain for a government press conference about how all the protests were settled, and heard instead of how there was brutal crackdown going on in a nearby town that very day, rushed to the scene, and were able to report the substance rather than the government-controlled show. \u00a0 But perhaps the best moment comes at the end of the interview, reproduced below. \u00a0(It starts about about minute 47:48 in the audio file.) Caller : \u00a0I was in Syria too, and it really bothers me that people like you that have such a rare and important experience, that you don't give your own opinion. \u00a0For instance why President Obama... or criticize him for not getting rid of Assad like he got rid of Quaddafi. \u00a0And I know your editors and people try to control it and won't let you but I think you could do that now and maybe you could just give me your comments. \u00a0It must be very frustrating that you don't give your opinion on what should be done. \u00a0You just report a story. McEvers : \u00a0Well, guess what? \u00a0The people's opinions are much more valuable than my opinion. \u00a0Like I was just a conduit. \u00a0I'll never forget this one woman. \u00a0I was at a funeral in a village in rebel-controlled Syria and it was the first guy to die in this village. And I was on the women's side, with the mourning, and this woman looked at me and she \"Where is America? Where is Obama? \u00a0What? Syrian children aren't as good as Libyan children?\" \u00a0She said \"You know something? We're not going to forget this. We're not going to forget that you forgot about us.\" And all I had to do was report that line. I'm sorry but I feel like that's 10,000 times more powerful than me getting up like some TV pundit and spouting my opinion. That's who I am. I'm a journalist. That's my job.\" How right she is. \u00a0What you choose to report is, of course, an expression of your opinion. \u00a0But the power of doing it directly, with other people's voices, is profound. Being a channel for otherwise unheard voices that matter can be so much more effective than explicit editorializing. via + Jennifer Pahlka \u00a0\ufeff",

Automation surprise occurs when we don't really have the mechanics of a new interface worked out. When that happens in a desktop or mobile application we shake our fists in frustration or cuss out loud, but when it is around a physical system like a car or an airplane, a lot more is at stake. As the robot revolution progresses, UX design will be seen as more than a \"nice to have.\" \u00a0It will literally save lives. via Jim Stogdill on the O'Reilly Radar backchannel.

At the same time, this is a long process, and we do need folks from Silicon Valley (and other tech hubs) to engage with it. \u00a0There's a lot to fix, and now is the time!\ufeff",

(The whole piece is long, but has many great moments. https://medium.com/p/e83510811c37 ): \"It\u2019s hard to watch the Olympics on TV in America because of the way they package it for Americans, trying to develop a sense that we are rooting for our country and making a connection to American athletes. So much is fabricated, and I wanted to see beyond that. I didn\u2019t come to root for TeamUSA, although I do care what Americans are doing and how American athletes are competing. But it is not why I came to Sochi. \"What I found special occurred surprisingly not at any of the events we went to, which included ski jumping, ice hockey and ice dancing, but took place two different times before a big screen TV inside the Adler transportation hub. We had just gotten off the train and there was a crowd of people looking up at the TV. All of them had stopped. The Russians were playing the US in curling, and the Americans had their last turn in a tie contest, as the stone went across the ice. It wasn\u2019t clear who won until one member of the Russian team raised his hands in celebration. Another day, the US was playing against Russia in hockey, and in the third period, the Russians scored a goal to tie the game. Both times, the crowd erupted in cheers, and a swelling of emotion that led to chanting \u201cRUS-SI-YA\u201d, \u201cRUS-SI-YA.\u201d http://youtu.be/zLvEtT2HcZM \"Something extraordinary was happening, and I realized that I shared their emotion, not because I rooted for the same team or same country, but I could ride the lifting emotion and energy, and its sudden appearance was something we all could enjoy. That was it, I thought at the time. That\u2019s what I came for.\"\ufeff",

The most obvious thing was not just that there were few Americans in the crowd, but few Europeans as well. The crowd was predominantly Russian tourists. This was an Olympics by and for the Russians. There was very little international character to the event.... \"Russia was on the stage, front and center, and even backstage. It was seen inside Russia as a triumph for Putin and the return of Russia to world prominence. It was also colorfully packaged as building the Russian brand for millions in a television audience watching from Europe and the US. Yet, as one American who had been to the Olympics in Vancouver said to me: \u201cThis is a somber Olympics.\u201d It was not a party for anyone but the Russians themselves, and they came from remote regions to get their pictures taken here, holding their own flag. Perhaps for them, like us, Sochi was a version of Russia that they had not seen before.\" Fascinating!\ufeff",

      "content": "Urban Office-steading in Brooklyn On Monday, I visited O'Reilly Media's small development office in Brooklyn, where Rune Madsen, Zach Schwartz, and Steve Klise\u00a0are working on our Atlas publishing tools (e.g.\u00a0 http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/ ). \u00a0They are holed up on the sixth floor of the old Pfizer Building on Flushing Avenue, with a spectacular view of the NY skyline. But what is most fun about the building is the way it is being developed. Rather than being a polished office building all ready for new tenants, it is being developed piecemeal in an exciting kind of urban reconstruction. After I had a look at the small office, we went on a tour of the vast undeveloped regions of the sixth floor, where rooms with mysterious purposes still remain, in skeletal form. \u00a0(Apparently, this was the area used to film the Green Goblin's lair in one of the Spider Man movies.) \u00a0In some areas, there are cinder block walls with holes knocked in them. \u00a0(Sadly, I somehow missed pictures of these.) Up on the eighth floor are a cluster of small food startups - pickles, bakeries, juice companies. \u00a0They apparently make the building a delight, because they sell lunch on many days.\u00a0 It struck me that this is a very different kind of redevelopment than I've seen in San Francisco. \u00a0Grittier, more frontier. I love it!\ufeff",

      "content": "I am somewhat appalled by the sloppy thinking of many of the Internet's latter-day critics. For example, in Joe Nocera's glowing review of Jaron Lanier's book, Who Owns The Future , I read: \"There are two additional components to Lanier\u2019s thesis.\u00a0The first is that the digital economy has done as much as any single thing to hollow out the middle class. (When I asked him about the effect of globalization, he said that globalization was \u201cjust one form of network efficiency.\u201d See what I mean about a universal theory?) His great example here is Kodak and Instagram. At its height, writes Lanier 'Kodak employed more than 140,000 people.' Yes, Kodak made plenty of mistakes, but look at what is replacing it: 'When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.'\u201d Think about it for a minute. Was it really Instagram that replaced Kodak? Wasn't it actually Apple, Samsung, and the other smartphone makers who have replaced the camera? \u00a0And aren't there network providers, data centers, and equipment suppliers who provide the replacement for the film that Kodak once sold? Apple has 72,000 employees ( up from 10,000 in 2002. http://bit.ly/1lEY8HG ). Samsung has 270,000 employees. \u00a0Comcast has 126,000. And so on. Of course, there was a much larger ecosystem of people making money from photography in the Kodak era than those who worked for Kodak directly, but so too, the digital ecosystem is far larger than Lanier's silly example suggests. An economic ecosystem is a lot like an iceberg. Most of it is underwater. And shallow pronouncements like the one above do us all a disservice. I do agree with Jaron Lanier's key point, as reported by Nocera: \u201cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\u201d\u00a0 I agree with that point - and have repeatedly warned about the risks. See for example, my 2007 observations about lessons from Wall Street for internet companies, Trading for Their Own Account ( http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/12/trading-for-their-own-account.html ), and my repeated urgings for companies to create more value than they capture ( http://bit.ly/1lF0d6y ). \u00a0But I don't actually believe that internet companies are hollowing out the economy, and I do believe that many of them do think about enriching their customers. \u00a0See for example Hal Varian's analysis of the economic impact of Google advertising ( http://www.google.com/economicimpact/ ) or my own analysis of the economic impact of the web hosting market on small business ( http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/open-source-small-business-report.html ). Contrast this with the damage to the economy done by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who have truly worked to enrich themselves at the expense of their customers and the public, and the Internet gets a pretty good grade. The full story of the economic impact of digital networks has yet to unfold, let alone to be understood. \u00a0There is an awful lot of blind internet boosterism, but the latest round of critics seem even more wilfully blind than those they lambaste. For more nuanced, thoughtful reading on the impact of the internet, Nocera would do better to read books like + Ethan Zuckerman 's _ Rewire_ ( http://www.amazon.com/Rewire-Digital-Cosmopolitans-Age-Connection/dp/0393082830 ) or Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolffsson's Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age ( http://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies-ebook/dp/B00D97HPQI/ ).\ufeff",

      "content": "I read Brad Stone's history of Amazon, The Everything Store , \u00a0over the holidays, and recommend it highly. \u00a0To be sure, it is incomplete and doubtless has many inaccuracies, but it gives insight into the mind of a remarkable man and the company he has built - a company with profound influence on the present and future shape of our society. I had heard scuttlebutt that the book was hostile to Amazon. \u00a0I didn't find that to be the case at all. In fact, it increased my admiration for Jeff and what he and his team have accomplished. After Steve Jobs died, everyone was saying \"Will we ever see his like again?\" \u00a0I would always respond, \"What do you mean? \u00a0He's already here, and his name is Jeff Bezos. \u00a0He's the only other tech entrepreneur I know who has transformed multiple industries, and shown the ability to work his magic not once but many times. \u00a0He's been the misunderstood underdog who came out on top because of vision, passion, and persistence.\" (OK, since then, Elon Musk has shown signs of pulling off the same ambition. But the fact remains that Jeff is one of the most important and successful entrepreneurs of our time.) Because of my admiration and liking for Jeff, \u00a0I was a bit dismayed to see the book position me as an \"adversary.\" \u00a0While in some ways I am a competitor to Amazon, I think of myself more as a partner and friend than any kind of adversary! \u00a0And while Jeff and I have occasionally butted heads, first about the 1-click patent back in 2000 (a conflict that ended up with us as friends), and later about some of Amazon's overly aggressive business tactics towards suppliers (described in chapter 10 of the book), and about the use of a proprietary DRM'd ebook format rather than open standards for the Kindle, I have always been a huge fan. One of the things the book gets across is what a great learner Jeff is. It makes clear just how freshly he responded to the challenges of growing his business, relying on some uncompromising principles but also adapting them so that, as long-time Amazon employee Rick Dalzell described, he always engaged his decision-making around \"the best truth at the time.\" (Chapter 9, page 267) His intense curiosity is one of the most striking things about him.\u00a0 The book also underplays Jeff's humanity, humor, and kindness. There are a lot of stories of how forceful, even abrasive, he sometimes is with subordinates - and I imagine that can be unpleasant. \u00a0But I also know just how hard it is to get thousands of people moving in the same direction without ruffling any feathers. And some of the changes that Jeff had to make to the company direction required enormous determination and force. I wish that some other leaders I know (e.g. in government) had equal clarity and determination. The book also really helped me see how deep Jeff's focus on the customer is. While I have always believed that focus to be sincere, I have also always worried that it would fade as the company became dominant, as is so often the case. \u00a0But the book makes clear again and again how it really is a touchstone for Jeff. I have also worried that focus on the customer isn't enough - that companies that become as powerful as Amazon also need to understand the complete ecosystem in which they operate. \u00a0The book's account of Amazon's sometimes brutal interactions with companies that it wanted to acquire, like Quidsi, the company behind diapers.com (page 298), and suppliers like German knife-maker Wusthof (page 300 and ff) makes clear that Amazon hasn't fully learned that lesson, and seems to believe that as long as customers benefit, it's ok to hurt suppliers. Sometimes that is true, when suppliers are inefficient or exploitive of their customers, but in other cases, squeezing all the profit out of suppliers' businesses is enormously short sighted. \u00a0The ideal ecosystem is one where everyone flourishes, not where one company flourishes at the expense of all the others. But I got a lot of hope from reading about Jeff's \"Amazon.love memo\" (Chapter 10, page 317-318), in which he analyzed why some big and powerful companies are hated, while others continue to engender love from not only their customers but their entire ecosystem. \u00a0In particular, I liked that one of the principles that Jeff distilled was this one: \"Capturing all the value only for the company is not cool.\" I've long urged companies to make \"Create more value than you capture\" their watchword, because it seems to me that building a healthy ecosystem in which everyone - employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and even competitors - can flourish is key to the positive impact that capitalism can have on society as a whole. \u00a0(See http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html ) The fact that Jeff is thinking about this as Amazon gets more dominant is a really good sign. \u00a0Some companies never realize that they need to be especially careful to create value for everyone as they get larger and more powerful.\u00a0 My chief beef about the book is that it skimped on some of the really big management lessons from Amazon. For me one of the most fascinating things about Amazon is the way that it seems to have modeled its organizational culture on its software. Stories I've heard about the way small teams are organized at Amazon remind me of the way modern modular software is designed. \u00a0I suspect that Amazon has cracked the code of the problem that was once laid out to me by the CIO of Fidelity Investments: \u00a0\"We know about all these new technologies. What we don't know is how to organize our company around them.\" \u00a0 In addition, I wish there were more written about the design of Amazon's internal services. When Jeff had the insight that led to the rise of Amazon as a platform - not only that its software needed to make the transition from a single monolithic application to a series of reusable web services, but also that those services should be designed in such a way that they could be re-used as easily by developers outside the company as by its internal units - he demonstrated a lesson that has yet to be learned by most large organizations. Take the recent healthcare.gov debacle. \u00a0One of the functions that the system depends on is income verification by the IRS. That lookup is, consistent with monolithic old-school software development, a tightly integrated part of the application rather than a true reusable service. If healthcare.gov were designed with the lessons of Amazon in mind, not only could the Federal healthcare.gov site call IRS web services to do income verification, but so could any of the state healthcare exchanges, or, for that matter, any private insurance company - or any company that needed to do income verification for any purpose. I realize that this is a general business book, and getting too deep on the technology might have scared off many readers, but I do hope that some future book about Amazon will give more than tantalizing glimpses of the interplay between the software architecture of a large-scale web enterprise like Amazon and the human and organizational architecture \u00a0that makes it possible for that software to be deployed in as agile a way as possible. I highly recommend this book. Amazon is one of the most important companies in the 21st century economy, and anyone whose business has been or will be touched by Amazon should be sure to read it.\ufeff",

      "content": "Google Teams Up with GM, Honda and Audi to Bring Android to Cars I'm intrigued but a bit skeptical about the newly announced initiative for an \"Open Automotive Alliance\" to bring Android to automobiles. \u00a0While I love the idea, there are two reasons I am reserving judgment: 1. The insatiable desire of vendors to \"differentiate\" on a standard platform, without thinking about what kinds of differentiation leads to real customer value. 2. The failure to understand that in today's world, it's not just about the software, but about data and services. This point is brought home to me every day by my Tesla Model S. While I love the car, I'm incredibly disappointed by its implementation of Google Maps (for which I paid an additional $3000 or so for the \"high tech package,\" without which navigation is disabled). The map display is awesome, especially the second turn-by-turn screen behind the steering wheel, and the directions are Google's. \u00a0But where does the traffic data come from? \u00a0Surely not from Google. \u00a0Any time I suspect there is traffic, I have to pull out my phone and use Google maps before I start, because Tesla's time estimates to destination are pathetically wrong. \u00a0Whatever data services they are using (or not using) to provide traffic estimates are completely useless. In short, I hope that automakers don't add bells and whistles to differentiate themselves, while neglecting core services that customers really depend on.\ufeff",

It's simply us -- and as defective or capable of goodness as we are. \"Today, several weeks into the botched launch of Obamacare's exchanges and several more since the shutdown, the faith of the people in government is weak and weakening further. \"This trend long predates Obamacare, and its sources are bipartisan. Democrats who favor more active government have tolerated an ever-more complex and impersonal state, while Republicans who want to shrink government love to showcase the breakdowns that complexity -- and GOP-led underfunding -- can bring. \"What's striking, though, is that both sides have learned to see and speak of government the same way -- as a disembodied thing, a mechanism separate from citizens. \"Democrats tend to forget and Republicans like to deny the simple reality that government is nothing more than our best attempt to do certain things together that we can't do alone. Like ensure that we are all insured against health catastrophes. Or keep toxic foods out of our babies' mouths. Or send humans to the moon. Or design smart transportation systems on Earth. \"When government fails, the proper response isn't fatalism; it's activism.\"\ufeff",

This is a management problem, and a cultural problem. The preferred method for implementing large technology projects in Washington is to write the plans up front, break them into increasingly detailed specifications, then build what the specifications call for. It\u2019s often called the waterfall method, because on a timeline the project cascades from planning, at the top left of the chart, down to implementation, on the bottom right. \"Like all organizational models, waterfall is mainly a theory of collaboration. By putting the most serious planning at the beginning, with subsequent work derived from the plan, the waterfall method amounts to a pledge by all parties not to learn anything while doing the actual work. Instead, waterfall insists that the participants will understand best how things should work before accumulating any real-world experience, and that planners will always know more than workers. \"This is a perfect fit for a culture that communicates in the deontic language of legislation. It is also a dreadful way to make new technology. If there is no room for learning by doing, early mistakes will resist correction. If the people with real technical knowledge can\u2019t deliver bad news up the chain, potential failures get embedded rather than uprooted as the work goes on.\"\ufeff",

It was always a promise of convenience (and automation and sleekness). What wasn\u2019t obvious, to me anyway, was that an Internet of Things could usher in a golden age for curiosity. Where everyone, even a luddite like me, was constantly at the edge of what was possible. Where a new adventure \u2014 a new set of questions about our world and our place in it \u2014 was only a group friends and an internet connection away.\" Or as Stewart Brand said, in the memorable quote that opens the piece: \u201c[In] the last century, discovery was basically finding things.

      "content": "Why Government Investment Makes Sense Now I was interested to see what appears to be a Libertarian-leaning author making the case for government spending in the face of the current worldwide economic situation. \u00a0Frankly, I wish the US and Europe were investing a lot more in infrastructure right now, and putting idle resources to work on stuff that matters while credit is still cheap. \u00a0We'll still have to do that stuff later on, when it will be more expensive, because by then the government will be competing with the private sector for resources. From the article: \"Governments particularly in Britain and the Eurozone have attempted to fight depressed growth using austerity policies (in the context of expansionary monetary policy). The proponents of austerity theorise that by promising to bring down taxes and spending, they will unleash private sector spending by reducing future expectations of taxes. To me, this has always seemed like a boneheaded and Rube Goldberg-style approach. Simply, the issue of depressed private economic activity is far more complex than future taxation expectations. And aggressive monetary policy has not succeeded in reversing the depression (even if it has probably made the depression less severe). So it has been entirely unsurprising to me to see this approach largely failing. I approach the problem in a far more direct manner. The solution to lowered growth and elevated (and involuntary) unemployment is relatively simple.Eventually someone will start using up the idle resources. This will either be the private sector once it independently gets over its slump in animal spirits, or it will be the government. With such huge volumes of idle capital, interest rates will remain very low until stronger appetite for credit re-emerges. In equilibrium theory, the low cost of credit will by itself start to re-energise borrowing appetite by making more projects potentially profitable. Of course, interest rates are far from the only factor that borrowers take into account when seeking credit, and so it is perfectly plausible that the economy \u2014 as it has done \u2014 can remain depressed even with very low rates due to deleveraging pressures, low expectations and low confidence, etc. So if the market is ill-suited to taking up the idle resources any time soon \u2014 lying as it is in a depressive, irrational strop \u2014 the only agent that can do so is the state. The fact of low interest rates allows this to kill two birds with one stone \u2014 the state can borrow money (utilising idle capital) to create jobs (utilising idle labour), raising interest rates and bringing down the unemployment rate. And this approach does not require anyone to make accurate predictions about the future. It simply requires a market economy, and a state willing to employ idle resources when they are idle, and to ease off using idle resources when unemployment becomes low and interest rates start to rise. \"Many \u2014 including probably Hayek himself \u2014 would argue that using up idle resources in such a manner will not allow the structure of production to adjust to the new economic reality. The state, Hayek would argue is a poor allocator of capital because it lacks the informational efficiency of the market. I would mostly agree with Hayek\u2019s objection, and note that I favour a predominantly market-based economy. Government interventions should be kept to a necessary minimum. Yet, in a depressionary environment, the structure of production deteriorates as resources lie idle. Unemployed workers lose skills, lose competitive edge and spend and invest less, further depressing the economy. Capital \u2014 factories, buildings, amenities, ideas, etc \u2014 deteriorates. Young workers may enter the labour force but never find a job. Crime rises, and shady fringe businesses like loan sharks thrive as the unemployed struggle to pay the bills. The social costs of mass unemployment are exceedingly high. The adjustment occurring in a depression is more like a rot. And it is absurd to rot your way to growth. Instead, by lowering unemployment and using up idle capital (preferably in a mix of state-run infrastructure and technology projects, and lending to new businesses) more businesses can be born into existence. Potentially successful new ideas can be tried out, and may find success in the marketplace. The formerly unemployed get to develop skills, habits and ideas, instead of sitting at home all day doing nothing, or hunting for jobs in a scarce and depressed marketplace. And money will go into people\u2019s pockets, spurring investment and consumption, fomenting more new business growth. This, in my view, is the best shot at getting a depressed and rotten structure of production out of the doldrums and back toward strong organic growth. Sooner or later, of course, the private sector will come back and begin to use up resources. But that could be a very, very, very long way away. If we want the structure of production to adjust to the new world and to continue adjusting as the world continues to change, letting huge quantities of resources sitting idle seems like a bad way to do it. Targeted fiscal policy can change that.\ufeff",

In the anthology, contemporary authors were asked to reflect on documents from the time. Heaney chose a poem by British poet Edward Thomas, \"As the Team's Head Brass,\" which is also reproduced in the article. It is even more poignant than Heaney's commemoration of it. \u00a0Through a conversation with a farmer plowing a field, Thomas' poem reflects on the emptiness of Britain, whose men went off to war and never came back. \u00a0Thomas himself joined their ranks shortly after writing his poem, and died in France the following year. The poems \u00a0reminded me of the plaque on one of the columns in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that never fails to bring tears to my eyes when I visit it. \u00a0It reads: TO THE MEMORY OF ONE MILLION MEN OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918, AND OF WHOM THE GREATER PART REST IN FRANCE One million men! \u00a0And that's just the Brits, Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Indians, and others from the British Empire. \u00a0Never mind the French, the Germans, and (in World War II, even more destructive though less pointless, the Jews, the Russians, and the Poles). It is good to remember that tumultuous time, and to reflect on how easy it is for things to go awry, for the human world to spin out of control into darkness. \u00a0But even more important, we can use this opportunity to reflect on\u00a0how little we have been asked to spend of our courage, our passion, and our lives confronting the great issues of our day.\ufeff",

We took a group lesson - with an age range from four to 86 - and as you can see, a splendid time was had by all. Our instructor and guide, Aurelia, was knowledgeable, patient, and a great teacher. What was most astonishing to me is how lightly a falcon lands on your wrist. It's like a breath of air, so light and controlled that if your eyes were closed, you might not be sure it had happened. My pictures were mediocre, and so I didn't bother sharing them. These, which I just got from my fellow grandparents, Australian painter Pamela Griffith ( http://www.pamelagriffith.com/ ) and her husband Ross, are magnificent, and give a sense of what it's like. Be sure to see the picture of my grandson eye-to-eye with a falcon!\ufeff",

She is a wonderful actress. \u00a0(If you've seen either The Help or Fruitvale Station , you will recognize her from those movies, as she bookends both of them with her expressive supporting roles.) \"But it's the less-known actors who are more revelatory. Ahna O'Reilly (who dated Franco for years) is astonishing as Dewey, the only daughter, recalling Sissy Spacek's performance in Badlands. Jim Parrack was a perennial highlight of mine on True Blood, where he played golden-hearted good old boy Hoyt, and Franco's use of him here is absolute genius. He brings naturalism and genuine soulfulness to his portrayal of oldest brother Cash. Logan Marshall-Green is the handsome guy from Prometheus, but he'll always be Ryan's bad news brother Trey Atwood from The O.C. to me. He made me forget about Trey in this movie by sporting a beard and a sometimes indecipherable accent and reminding me of Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.\"\ufeff",

      "content": "+ Clay Shirky \u00a0gave a wonderful keynote yesterday at the Code for America Summit. My favorite quote of the talk was\u00a0\"The most important resource you've got is your own ability to change your mind.\" He illustrated this point with the failure that was Nupedia, whose founders and community went on to create Wikipedia. \"It's not what you do first. It's what you do next,\" Clay said. \u00a0\"Wikipedia was Plan B.\" \u00a0 This talk - given to open government advocates - is particularly appropriate in the context of the current discussion about failures in government IT procurement. \u00a0After all, if you what you've specified is Nupedia, and the rules don't let you change your mind, you never get Wikipedia...\ufeff",

But normal people do not announce that if their spouse does not give in, they will break all the windows in the house. Hard-line House Republicans seem to think that their ability to inflict pain on 800,000 federal workers by furloughing them without pay gives them bargaining chips. The hard-liners apparently believe that their negotiating position is strengthened when they demonstrate that they can wreck American governance. The stakes rise as we approach the debt limit and the risk of default \u2014 which the Treasury Department notes could have an impact like that of the 2008 financial crisis and \u201chas the potential to be catastrophic.\u201d Astonishingly, Republican hard-liners see that potential catastrophe as a source of bargaining power in a game of extortion: We don\u2019t want anything to happen to this fine American economy as we approach the debt limit, so you\u2019d better meet our demands. In this situation, it strikes a false note for us as journalists to cover the crisis simply by quoting each side as blaming the other. That\u2019s a false equivalency.\"\ufeff",

      "content": "How Beautiful Interfaces Create Trust and Loyalty Reading Farhad Manjoo's recent article about Google's new commitment to design and the difference it is making, I was struck by the word \"beauty.\" \u00a0Steve Jobs' success at Apple made the word a key part of the strategic business lexicon, and now Google is executing on the beauty game plan. Government needs to learn the same lesson. In particular, I was struck by the parallels between Larry Page's pursuit of beauty in Google products and White House Deputy CTO Jennifer Pahlka's assertion that one of the best ways to restore faith in government is to create interfaces to government services that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use. (Jen is also the founder of Code for America.) From POLITICO's profile of Jen when she went to work for the the White House: \"Jennifer Pahlka thinks of a good government website as nothing less than a way to improve democracy. If the site is 'simple, beautiful and easy to use, you feel differently about government'\" ( http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/50-politicos-to-watch-jennifer-pahlka-94195.html#ixzz2g6FkSUcD ) From Manjoo's article: \"With the rise of sleek, portable touch-screen computers--i.e., the rise of Apple--people were now interacting with software in the same hands-on way they do with cars, clothes, appliances, and other physical goods. \"Our expectations of the real world began transferring to the virtual world,\" [lead designer for Google Search, Jon] Wiley says. Google's designers needed to address questions that they'd scarcely considered before: How do you feel when you use the product? Is it friendly, exciting, disorienting? Is it beautiful? \"The evidence suggested they weren't meeting those goals. In 2010, Google conducted a series of user tests to find out how people felt about Android. The results were stark: 'A lot of people felt that Android was essential to their lives, but they didn't like Android,' [Android Design Director Matias] Duarte says. The robust abilities of the OS 'made them feel small. It wasn't empowering, but daunting.' The same could be said for other Google products. When you loaded up something made by Google, you were more likely to feel overwhelmed than welcomed. \"Page took the two goals, beauty and cohesiveness, and combined them into a single mandate for designers: He called it 'One Beautiful Google.'\" And the results speak for themselves. \u00a0 I've often heard a similar notion from Jen -- that contemporary technology has raised the bar for government. When people can get information instantly on their smartphone, when companies like Amazon can have a product on your doorstep in less than a day, when these services are not only powerful but simple, beautiful, and easy to use, government looks even more like a bad bargain. If Barack Obama really wants to restore faith in government, and change the poisonous dialogue in Washington, he could do worse than pay attention to what Larry Page has done at Google, putting beauty and simplicity in government services at the heart of the legacy that his administration will leave the American people. Again, from Manjoo's article: \"While Page has never suggested a single design element, he was crucial to the redesign for the simple reason that he made it a firmwide priority. 'Only the CEO can get the entire company to focus on something,' says Wiley.\" Disclosure: Jen Pahlka is my fianc\u00e9, and I am on the board of Code for America.\ufeff",

      "content": "What I don't like about my Tesla Model S Everyone loves the Tesla Model S. \u00a0And I agree with most of the hype. It\u2019s a delightful car to drive, with a head-turning design, and all my worries about range have proven to be completely unnecessary. \u00a0(I do have the 85 battery.) \u00a0There are wonderful little grace notes, like the app that tracks the location of the car (which has already saved me once from losing my car in a vast airport parking lot, and let me decide that there was time to run back to the bathroom when being picked up at the airport.) The navigation system (with the tech package) is superb. I love that there\u2019s a small \u201cnext turn\u201d display right behind the steering wheel so you don\u2019t have to look over at the main screen. And the audio volume even goes to 11! :-) But it\u2019s not perfect. In the spirit of being helpful to the designers of future models, I thought I\u2019d list some things that I find less than perfect. \u00a0In no particular order: * If the door isn\u2019t completely shut, the car refuses to lock at all. This means that if your kid doesn\u2019t shut the door hard enough, and you walk away without looking, your car remains unlocked. The first time this happened, my car was rifled through during the night, and anything moveable was taken. * The control panel is so big and lovely, with so many options, that it is really dangerous until you spend the time to learn where everything is. You don\u2019t want to be looking for how to turn on the defroster when you are driving! \u00a0You need to figure out where all the commonly needed options are before you start. \u00a0Once you get used to it, it\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a little alarming at first. Take the time to train your eye and hand! * The bluetooth is flaky. (What bluetooth isn\u2019t?) At times, it works delightfully, automatically switching to my phone when I step into the car in the middle of a call. At worst, though, the entertainment system got totally wedged, thinking it was connected to Audible on my phone, and having that non-working display even overwrite maps and directions. I had to restart the display. (Hold down both buttons on the steering wheel till it reboots.) * The key, lovely as it is - an art object in itself - is designed in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to put on a key-ring with other keys (except with a cord rather than a ring.) * There is no spare tire. \u00a0This is probably OK, but it worries me. And I didn't realize it till I got the car home. Tesla should do a better job of making this clear, and what to do if you have a flat. (The car can't be towed, has to go on a flatbed truck.) * Visibility out the back is mediocre. * It gets pretty hot in the way back for kids in the kid seats. (This is a known problem, and they\u2019ve suggested workarounds.) * I miss the little sunglass holder up by the roof that was sported by our Prius. * I\u2019d love if the back-up display drew lines (like in modern sports events) to show me the location of the sides of the car relative to the display. The wide-angle lens takes some getting used to, the car seems wider than I\u2019m used to (not sure whether it is, but it feels that way) and I have a hard time telling how close the wheel is to the kerb or other obstacles. There are probably other things that nag me, but this list will do for now. Just a reminder that no one is perfect...\ufeff",
